Once Laura Loomer questioned whether Taylor Swift was in an arranged relationship with Travis Kelce to influence the 2024 election. Referring to that Bill Maher wondered whether Laura Loomer is in an arranged relationship to affect the election because 'she's very close to Trump'.""She's 31, looks like his type. We did an editorial here a few years ago. It was basically who is Trump f**king. Because I said, you know, it's not nobody. He's been a dog for too long. And it's not Melania. I think we may have our answer this week. I think it might be Laura Loomer. I am just saying,"" Bill Maher said.Laura Loomer reacted to the allegation with a legal warning and said this is complete and blatant lied. ""I have never in my life seen such a coordinated attack by the mainstream Media, the White House and leftist personalities to target a private citizen and investigative journalist simply because I flew on a plane and I support Donald Trump,"" she said.""This is unacceptable. And it's a full blown LIE and incredibly disrespectful to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. It's very obvious some type of memo went out because the reaction to what I said is completely overblown and it's a full blown character assassination campaign. This is a full blown lie from @billmaher, and he is maliciously and deliberately defaming me,"" Laura said.Laura Loomer is a conspiracy theorist who has come very close to Donald Trump's campaign. Loomer was seen travelling with Trump on his private jet and GOP insiders fear that she is a bad influence on Trump and probably it was her influence that Trump mentioned the rumors of Haitian immigrants eating pets at the debate.Trump distanced from Laura Loomer and said she does not work from his campaign. She's a private citizen and a longtime supporter. ""I disagree with the statements she made but, like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me, even to the point of doing anything to stop their Political Opponent, ME!"" Trump posted."

As a precautionary measure, firefighters also used an aircraft to drop fire retardant on the area surrounding the electric truck .The NTSB sent investigators to the crash site along Interstate 80 near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, to examine the fire risks associated with the truck's large lithium-ion battery .The agency found that the truck was not operating on any of Tesla's partially automated driving systems at the time of the crash, as they were not operational and ""could not be engaged,"" reported news agency AP.The crash occurred at approximately 3.13 am when a Tesla employee was driving the tractor-trailer from Livermore, California, to a Tesla facility in Sparks, Nevada. The Semi veered off the road while navigating a curve to the right, hitting a tree and coming to rest against several trees after descending a slope. The driver was uninjured in the incident.Following the crash, the Semi's lithium-ion battery caught fire. Firefighters used water to extinguish the flames and cool the batteries, resulting in a 15-hour closure of the freeway to ensure the batteries were sufficiently cooled for recovery. The truck was then transported to an open-air facility and monitored for 24 hours, during which time the battery did not reignite.The NTSB is investigating all aspects of the crash to determine its cause and intends to issue safety recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future. In a previous investigation that concluded in 2021, the agency found that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that manufacturer guidelines for dealing with such fires were inadequate.The NTSB called for manufacturers to create vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires, limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition, and providing information on safely storing vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries.Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk announced the company would start producing the trucks. Musk has stated that the Semi has a range of 500 miles (800 kilometers) per charge when hauling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load."

As far-right activist Laura Loomer continues to dominating the news cycle, she said she is being targeted because she broke the story about Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff 's affair. This affair brough an end to Doug's marriage with Kerstin and Doug admitted that he had an extra-marital affair with his daughter Ella Emhoff's teacher.""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions.I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff recently said. Now Doug, Kerstin, Kamala Harris, Ella and Cole Emhoff are part of the big modern family with everyone showing up as the Democratic National Convention where Kamala Harris accepted the party's nomination as the presidential candidate.It did not stop at being an affair as according to reports, Doug got his daughter's teacher Najen Naylor pregnant. She, however, did not keep the child.The long-forgotten incidents came to the surface with Kamala Harris getting the Democrat ticket though all these took place before Doug married Kamala Harris. Now, Laura Loomer said since she broke the news, she's being targeted.But she's not being targeted by the Democrats. Many Republican heavyweights including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lindsey Graham did not endorse her racist attack on Kamala Harris as she said the White House will smell of curry if Kamala Harris wins the election.""I broke the story about @KamalaHarris's husband having an affair and knocking his daughter's teacher up. I exposed Judge Merchan and his daughter and her business partner. I broke the story about Governor Tim Walz's @GovTimWalz brother accusing Kamala Harris of turning our country into a Third World banana Republic, and embarrassed him when I exposed and exclusively reported that his family was endorsing Donald Trump,"" Laura said.She also took the credit of breaking the story that Kamala Harris faked an interaction with supporters who actually were Democrat volunteers.""I have done some serious damage to her campaign, and so clearly there is a coordinated effort by the media, Kamala Harris, Fani Willis, probably judge Merchan and his daughters' company, and some RINO members of Congress to attack me because they don't like how effective I am,"" Laura said.""They have devoted three whole days of nonstop media coverage to me on every single news network. I have received over 875 phone calls from reporters. I am getting death threats, And all I did was say ""the White House was going to smell like curry"" because Kamala spends more time cooking than talking policy,"" Laura added.Laura Loomer is a 31-year-old conspiracy theorist who said 9/11 was an inside job. Her former Twitter account got suspended in 2018 and she was banned from Instagram, FB, PayPal, GoFundMe, Uber for her anti-Muslim rhetoric. Twitter banned her for her attack on Ilhan Omar. She has been advocating for Donald Trump's re-election but the fringe got mainstreamed when she was seen accompanying Donald Trump on Trump's plane. Her proximity with Trump did not go down well with MAGA veterans.Trump addressed the controversy and said Laura is a free-spirited supporter. He made it clear that he does not endorse Laura's hateful comments but he welcomes her support."

We need to unitedly fight against such people.""This is, however, not the first time when Rijiju has rebuked fugitive Naik.A few days ago, he tore into the controversial Islamic preacher for peddling false ""propaganda"" on the Wafq bill.Taking strong exception to Naik's call to reject the bill, the Union minister sternly warned against ""misleading"" the Indian Muslims from abroad.The scathing rebuttal by the Union minister came on the back of a controversial social media post by Naik, where he called on Indian Muslims to ""save Indian Waqf properties, reject the Waqf Amendment Bill.""""Please do not mislead the innocent Muslims from outside our country. India is a democratic country and people have the right to their own opinion,"" Rijiju wrote.""False propaganda will lead to wrong narratives,"" the Union minister said.The Waqf Amendment Bill, introduced to reform the management of Waqf properties, faced opposition from certain quarters of both the opposition and coalition partners during the recent parliamentary session.As a result, it was sent for broader consultation. Since then, the bill has been reviewed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.The committee's chairman, Jagdambika Pal has stressed that they are actively discussing ideas and recommendations to draft a bill that will benefit the poor, women, children, and the minority community as a whole."

What is its use? Are 'truth-serums' admissible in court of law? What are stages of test? NEW DELHI: The additional chief judicial magistrate's court in Sealdah denied the CBI 's request to perform a narco-analysis on Sanjay Roy , the main accused in the R G Kar rape and murder case, after Roy refused to give his consent. The agency had previously conducted a polygraph test on Roy.On Friday afternoon, the CBI brought Roy to the Sealdah ACJM court after noticing discrepancies in his statements during the last two days of interrogation.Roy was summoned into the magistrate's chamber, where he gave his statement in private, while his lawyer and CBI lawyers waited outside.Prior to this, Roy was informed about the narco-analysis procedure, which involves the administration of an intravenous drug and subjecting him to various stages of anaesthesia . The CBI opted for a narco-analysis on Roy due to inconsistencies in his statements. The process requires the administration of intravenous drugs, known as 'truth-serums', such as sodium pentothal, scopolamine, and sodium amytal directly into the bloodstream. This drug, commonly utilised to induce a state of general anesthesia during surgical operations, leads the individual to experience a hypnotic trance-like state. As a result, during the hypnotic stage of the narco-analysis, a person becomes more uninhibited and less restrained in their behavior and responses and is more likely to disclose information that would not be revealed in a conscious state. The use of narcotics and hypnotic techniques (truth-serums) for interrogation purposes has a long history. Predecessors to the current narco analysis method employed drugs like scopolamine and sodium amytal. These substances were used in an attempt to induce a state of heightened suggestibility and lower inhibitions in subjects, with the aim of eliciting truthful statements or confessions. However, the reliability and ethical implications of such practices have been widely debated.The term 'truth serum' was coined as a result of the application of the 'Scopolamine' method. Over time, sodium amytal injections became a popular means to encourage subjects to speak openly, especially within the field of psychiatric practice.The drug-induced hypnotic state is valuable for investigators because it increases the likelihood of the subject revealing information.In the landmark case of 'Selvi & Ors. vs State of Karnataka' decided in 2010, the then Chief Justice of India, K G Balakrishnan, delivered a significant ruling regarding the use of certain investigative techniques that no individual should be ""forcibly"" subjected to these techniques. The SC ruled that the use of narcoanalysis, brain mapping, and polygraph tests on suspects without their consent is unconstitutional.The judgment clearly stated that no person should be compelled to undergo these methods against their will, irrespective of whether it is during a criminal investigation or in any other context. The court determined that these methods infringe upon the ""right against self-incrimination"" guaranteed under Article 20(3) and the ""right to privacy"" protected by Article 21.The results of a test conducted on an individual, even with their consent, are inadmissible as evidence in a court of law. This is because the subject lacks conscious control over their responses during the examination. Nevertheless, any subsequent discoveries, information, or material obtained as a result of the test can be presented as evidence.It is important to note that while the test results themselves are not admissible, they may lead to the uncovering of relevant information or material that can be used in legal proceedings. This distinction is crucial, as it allows for the utilisation of valuable insights gained from the test without relying on the test results as direct evidence.It was held that during the administration of 'narco analysis technique', it is essential to comply with the guidelines issued by the National Human Rights Commission in 2000, titled ""Guidelines for the Administration of Polygraph Test (Lie Detector Test) on an Accused"".The test consists of four stages: a pre-test interview, pre-narcotic stage, semi-narcotic stage, and post-narcotic stage. A team of professionals, including a forensic psychologist, an anaesthesiologist, a psychiatrist, a general physician, or other medical staff, is present during the process, and a videographer records the proceedings.Roy's lawyer, Kabita Sarkar , argued that despite claims of narco-analysis being safe, it cannot be completely trusted. ""Chances of going back to normal life are slim after the test is done,"" she said."

Leo Kryss, co-founder of Tectoy , accuses Douglas Elliman of misleading him about the buyer's identity, according to The Wall Street Journal.Kryss listed his seven-bedroom, 11 1/2-bathroom home in Miami Beach's Indian Creek Village for $85 million.The firm allegedly told him the buyer would not pay more than $79 million. Kryss asked the firm's CEO, Jay Parker, if Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was the buyer. ""Parker misleadingly assured Kryss that Bezos was not behind the offer and was not the purchaser,"" states the lawsuit filed in July.After selling the property for $79 million, Kryss discovered that Bezos was indeed the buyer. Kryss argues that knowing Bezos was interested would have impacted his negotiation and final sale price. Wealthy buyers often hide their identities to avoid price increases.Bezos is the world's second richest person, with a net worth of $204 billion. Kryss claims the mansion would be more valuable to Bezos due to his property holdings in the area. Bezos' real estate portfolio includes properties in New York, Beverly Hills, West Texas, and Washington, DC.The lawsuit was filed in the 11th Judicial Circuit in Miami-Dade County. Kryss' Miami mansion is in Indian Creek Village, home to prominent figures like Ivanka Trump and Tom Brady."

Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/https://world/middle-east/iran-successfully-launches-research-satellite-sparks-western-concerns/articleshow/113345082.cms,"Iran launched a research satellite into orbit on Saturday using a rocket developed by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard , according to the state-run IRNA news agency.The Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms, reached a 550-kilometer orbit in space. The main mission of the satellite is to test space hardware and software.IRNA also mentioned that land stations have received signals from the satellite.The satellite's carrier rocket, Qaem-100 , was designed and made by the Guard's aerospace division and uses solid fuel. Iran plans 13 more satellite launches.This is the second launch this year, first under President Masoud Pezezhkian, following the death of his predecessor Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. In January, Iran claimed to have successfully launched three satellites into space with a rocket.Western nations view the program as part of Tehran's efforts to enhance its ballistic missiles.The US military has alleged that Iran could utilise its satellite launch technology for potential long-range weapons development, including the possibility of nuclear warheads. The military claims that the ballistic technology employed to send satellites into space could also be used to launch long-range weapons.However, Iran refutes these allegations, stating that its satellite activities are not a front for developing ballistic missiles. The country also maintains that it has never sought to develop nuclear weapons.The United States has previously stated that Iran's satellite launches violate a UN Security Council resolution and has called on Tehran to refrain from any activities involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. However, UN sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program expired last October.Under former President Hassan Rouhani, Iran slowed its space program to avoid tensions with the West. However, Raisi, who took office in 2021, accelerated the program before dying. Iran's new president, reformist Masoud Pezeshkian , has not yet clarified his stance on the space initiative.The US intelligence community has warned that Iran's satellite launch vehicle development could shorten its timeline for creating intercontinental ballistic missiles, which can deliver nuclear weapons. While Iran denies pursuing nuclear arms and claims its space and nuclear programs are civilian, international agencies believe Iran had a military nuclear program until 2003.Despite having one of the most extensive missile programs in the Middle East, Iran has experienced multiple unsuccessful satellite launches in recent years, which have been attributed to technical problems. The launch also coincides with heightened tensions in the Middle East due to Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, raising concerns about a potential regional conflict."

Overreacting to each of these would, in my view, call into question diplomatic judgment,"" Koizumi said when asked about the deal.Sanae Takaichi, Japan's minister in charge of economic security and another prime ministerial candidate, also defended the deal during the same debate attended by eight other Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership contenders on Saturday.""It appears they are using (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) CFIUS to frame this as an economic security issue,"" she said.""However, Japan and the US are allies, and the steel industry is about strengthening our combined resilience.""The 43-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the junior Koizumi, is seen as a leading contender in the Sept. 27 race to pick the LDP's new leader, who will become the next prime minister due to the party's control of parliament.Koizumi said on Saturday that he would seek a dialogue with the North Korean leadership to resolve the issue over the abduction of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s.""We want to explore new opportunities for dialogue between people of the same generation, without being bound by conventional approaches, and without preconditions,"" Koizumi said."

""That's because the very good law firm which had been engaged by the Indian Olympic Association was told by some lawyers, who the athlete had engaged, that 'we will not share anything with you, we will not give anything to you'. It was very late (that) we got everything.""Salve added that his team fought the case hard and also offered Vinesh to appeal against the CAS verdict in the Swiss Court.

Here's how you can beat obesity due to overwork? Here's what stress does to your health You must have come across several side effects of stress, especially the one you get at the workplace. But, has it ever crossed your mind that the stress generated due to the workplace can lead to weight gain ? You are surprised, right?A bizarre consequence of workplace stress has been seen in a 24 year old woman from China.According to media reports, Ouyang Wenjing from China's Guangdong province has claimed that job related stress made her gain 20 kilos in just one year.Wenjing shared her story on the social media platform Xiaohongshu. ""My job became a disaster for my physical and mental health,"" she revealed in an interview with news outlet Star Video.As per reports, she is currently 80 kilos and gained weight from 60 kilos due to overwork obesity .Overwork obesity refers to weight gain and obesity that are primarily driven by excessive work-related stress and long working hours. This phenomenon is increasingly recognized in today's fast-paced work environment, where individuals often face prolonged periods of sedentary behavior, irregular eating habits, and high-stress levels.When people work excessively long hours, they may skip meals or rely on convenient, unhealthy food options that are high in calories and low in nutrients. Stress can also lead to emotional eating, where individuals use food as a coping mechanism. The lack of time and energy for physical activity exacerbates the problem, contributing to weight gain and an increased risk of obesity.The mental strain from overwork can disrupt sleep patterns, further impacting metabolism and promoting weight gain. The combination of poor dietary choices, reduced physical activity, and sleep disturbances creates a cycle that is challenging to break.Since the impact of workplace stress is so heavy, you need to take measures to prevent the onset of obesity. Maintaining workplace stress generated obesity needs a holistic approach.Focus on eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-calorie snacks should be reduced. Portion control is important too; smaller and more frequent meals control the urge to overeat. An adequate intake of foods high in fiber will help satisfy satiety and aid in digestion.Regular physical activity helps with weight control. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week through moderate-intensity aerobic activities, like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Muscle-strengthening activities are recommended on at least two or more days during the week.Getting enough sleep is one of the important aspects of stress management . Lack of sleep imbalances hormones, increases appetite, and results in gaining more pounds. Quality sleep for about seven to nine hours can help the body relax overnight. Keeping a sleep schedule is essential.Practice mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or leisure activities with social contact to reduce stress. Combining alternative coping methods, such as writing in a diary or speaking with a therapist, can assist in addressing stress and binging behaviors.Seek support with healthcare providers, like a dietitian, exercise physiologist, or therapist."

During a meeting at the White House with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer , Biden grew visibly irritated when a reporter from the British press corps asked him to comment on Putin's statement that lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles could escalate the conflict into a direct US-Russia war, reported the New York Post.""Be quiet until I speak, okay? That's what I say. Good idea?"" Biden retorted, visibly frustrated. The reporter continued to press, asking Biden to address Putin's serious threat.Biden responded curtly, ""You've got to be quiet. I'm going to make a statement here, okay?""The exchange highlighted a potential miscommunication, as the journalist seemed unfamiliar with the protocol of waiting for the president to finish his remarks before asking questions. Following Biden and Starmer's brief introductory statements, the reporter again posed the question, leading Biden to dismissively comment, ""I don't think much about Vladimir Putin.""The incident comes amid heightened tensions over the conflict in Ukraine. On Monday, Biden confirmed that he was considering relaxing restrictions on the use of US-supplied weapons by Ukraine, a move that has provoked a stern warning from Putin. The Russian leader stated that such a decision would be interpreted as an act of war, potentially implicating NATO countries, including the US and its European allies, in the conflict.Putin warned, ""This will mean that NATO countries -- the US and European countries -- are at war with Russia,"" and hinted at possible responses based on the new threats posed to Russia.As the war in Ukraine continues into its third year, concerns about a potential nuclear escalation persist. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken increasingly bold actions against Russian forces, including a surprise invasion of Russian territory on August 6. This move has complicated peace negotiations and influenced US political dynamics as the November 5 election approaches.Former President Donald Trump has pledged to swiftly negotiate a peace deal if elected, although there are fears that this could lead to Ukraine conceding territory currently held by Russia in the country's south and east."

The match may not have produced classical hockey from two best teams in the world at that time, but it kept India's unbeaten run in the Olympics since 1928 intact, as Randhir Singh Gentle's goal in the third minute of a penalty bully (now called penalty corner) led to India's sixth consecutive gold medal.Pakistan ended India's run of six consecutive gold medals with a 1-0 victory through Naseer Ahmed Bunda's goal to avenge their defeat at the Games four years ago.For the third consecutive edition of the Olympics, India and Pakistan reached the final to showcase their continued dominance in world hockey. It was India's turn to take revenge for their loss in the 1960 final; but like the previous two gold-medal matches, this too produced just a solitary goal that came off the stick of Mohinder Lal in the 40th minute. It proved to be the winning goal in India's 1-0 victory.India etched its name in the annals of sports history by securing their first and only World Cup title with a win over Pakistan in the final. The momentous day came just two years after the heartbreak of the 1973 final, when India suffered a devastating loss. The team led by Ajit Pal Singh rose to the occasion in the final held at the Merdeka Football Stadium in Kuala Lumpur. The match was a closely contested affair, with Pakistan taking an early lead through Muhammad Zaid Sheikh. Surjit Singh scored the equalizer for India. The decisive goal came when Ashok Kumar, the son of the legendary Dhyan Chand, found the back of the net, securing a thrilling 2-1 victory.The Indian team emerged victorious, securing the gold medal after a 16-year hiatus. In a thrilling showdown, India displayed unwavering determination as they triumphed over their archrivals with a score of 4-2 in a nail-biting shoot-out. Before that, India last became Asian Games champions in 1998. The closely contested battle saw the teams locked 1-1 at the end of regulation time.Regarded as one of the best India-Pakistan encounters in the sport, India staged a remarkable comeback to secure a 7-4 victory, scoring five goals in the final 19 minutes of the game, resulting in a triumph that remains fresh in the memory of hockey fans. India's goal-scorers were Jugraj Singh, Deepak Thakur, Prabhjot Singh and Gagan Ajit Singh, while Pakistan's goals came from Rehan Butt, Nadeem Ahmed, Mudassar Ali, and Sohail Abbas. The game marked the first instance where India managed to score seven goals against Pakistan.India missed a chance to take the game to a shootout, losing 3-4 in a tense semifinal. Pakistan's Muhammad Arslan Qadir scored the winning goal just one minute before the end of the match, which led to maddening scenes in Bhubaneswar. The post-match celebrations by the Pakistani players sparked controversy as some of them removed their shirts and made indecent and obscene gestures towards the crowd and Indian media. This incident further strained relations between the two nations. Pakistan's other goals were scored by Muhammad Waqas and Muhammad Irfan, while India's goals came from Gurjinder Singh, Dharamvir Singh, and Nikkin Thimmaiah."

On the other hand, Yogi (Adityanath) ji sees criminals as criminals only. This is the difference between Yogi ji and Akhilesh Yadav. Akhilesh saw only caste during his tenure and encouraged hooliganism.""Singh also criticised opposition reactions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending a Ganesh puja at Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud's residence. ""If the people of the tukde-tukde gang go to Hamid Ansari's house wearing caps and are present on Bakrid, it is very good. But if someone goes to a judge's house for Ganesh puja, they feel bad.

We will raise this again before the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA),"" said a senior official from Karnataka's water resources department.According to Karnataka, approximately 400 tmcft of water flows into the sea after the riparian states have utilised their quotas. The petition for the allocation of surplus water, estimated to be around 100 tmcft, remains pending before the Supreme Court.Meanwhile, the CWMA has referred the detailed project report (DPR) on the Mekedatu project , submitted by Karnataka, to the Central Water Commission (CWC) for a techno-feasibility study.""Karnataka should also present a strong case for the allocation of surplus water before the Supreme Court, as the case is still pending. Additionally, expediting the process for the Mekedatu project is crucial,"" remarked irrigation expert Captain Raja Rao.Under the Supreme Court's verdict that adjusted the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal's final award, Karnataka is obligated to release 177 tmcft to Tamil Nadu, which has a total annual quota of 404 tmcft, from June to May.According to Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka State Federation of Farmers Organisation, the two states and the Centre should collaborate to build a consensus on the project.On Friday, the federation submitted a memorandum to V Somanna, Union minister of state for Jal Shakti, urging expedited construction of the Mekedatu reservoir project. A section of farmers from both states have proposed a shared reservoir at Rasimanal, on the border.""We will engage both the states in the dialogue regarding Cauvery river water sharing and seek an amicable solution. We also need to await the Supreme Court's decision on the pending case,"" said Somanna after receiving the memorandum."

While a few STPs conducted water tests once a month, some others tested water twice a month. Inconsistency in parameters tested was found in 67% of the STPs as they were not testing for all parameters notified by the KSPCB in 2021.""He also pointed out that some of the STPs stated consistent values for faecal coliform, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD).""The water quality reports for Challakere and Kalena Agrahara lakes revealed identical and consistent values for three continuous months, suggesting potential irregularities in the water sampling or reporting process,"" he said.He also explained that some of these missing parameters during the tests are factors causing eutrophication, algal bloom, and damage to the quality of water. Andrahalli, Bhattarahalli, Dasarahalli, Herohalli, Uttarahalli and Dorekere lakes lacked BOD, indicating higher levels of biological content and raising questions over the effectiveness of STPs.Referring to increased incidence of fishkill in the city lakes in 2023, the research report said, ""Four such incidents were reported at Iblur, Challakere and Bhattarahalli Lakes, which are attached to the BBMP STPs . These incidents highlight the potential shortcomings in pollution control and water quality management efforts. The occurrences of fishkills , despite the presence of STPs, indicate a possible failure in addressing water quality issues adequately. Further investigation is necessary to assess specific factors contributing to these incidents and implement corrective measures to prevent their recurrence."""

He is an excellent choice for captaincy in T20s. In white-ball cricket, I don't see anyone else more suitable for the role.Removing him from the captaincy was unjust. He is one of the best T20 players, and I've noticed his performance has slightly declined since he was removed from the captaincy.""Moin pointed out that frequently changing captains could affect player performance, noting, ""How can you expect good performance if you don't give players confidence? They should be given some time as captain."" Babar Azam stepped down from captaincy after Pakistan's poor performance in the 2023 ODI World Cup. Shaheen Afridi was then appointed as T20I captain, and Shan Masood as Test captain. However, after a 1-4 series loss to New Zealand, Afridi was replaced by Babar Azam just before the 2024 T20 World Cup .The frequent leadership changes have sparked concerns about Pakistan's long-term team strategy. Although Babar Azam remains a significant player, there have been talks of other leadership options, includingMohammad Rizwan , especially after Pakistan's home Test series loss to Bangladesh under Masood's captaincy.Moin stressed the importance of a stable leadership approach, suggesting, ""A single captain can be appointed for all formats, but it's crucial for any player to perform consistently across formats to achieve this. Mohammad Rizwan could be a great short-term captain, but you would need to groom a young cricketer to take over in the future. We often appoint captains but fail to prepare a suitable deputy.""The Pakistan Cricket Board now faces the challenge of maintaining stability while developing future leaders for the team."

While skipper Ammad Butt weighs in with experience, the young strikeforce of Ahmad Nadeem and Hannan Shahid can prove to be a handful for the Indian defenders. One player who will be watched is Sufyan Khan, a 20-year-old drag-flicker, who will look to prove himself after Pakistan's low success rate in penalty corner conversions in the tournament thus far.On the eve of the match, Butt said, ""India have played like true favourites in the tournament so far. But we will take heart from the matches we have played. We have improved in every game and have played disciplined hockey.""On the other hand, India, having rested a few from the Olympic team, have given youngsters a chance. Striker Gurjot Singh, who was handed a debut against China has given a good account of himself along with other youngsters like Araijeet Singh Hundal, Uttam Singh, and Mohd Raheel.The strike duo of Sukhjeet Singh and Abhishek has continued with the good form since Paris. The coordination of the youngsters in the frontline has been heartening and promising."

David Moot purchased a three-bedroom house overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, located just 7.6 metres from a crumbling cliff.The waterfront property comes at a discounted price because of the risk of being submerged due to rising sea levels and coastal erosion caused by the climate crisis .""Life's too short, and I just said to myself, 'Let's just see what happens,'"" Moot told Bloomberg . ""It's going to eventually fall into the ocean, and it may or may not be in my lifetime,"" he added.Cape Cod is one of many areas along the east coast of the United States experiencing major beach erosion. Stephen Leatherman, a professor and director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University, said the area has an average erosion rate of more than 3 feet per year. ""Along the east coast of the United States, 80% to 90% of the beaches are eroding,"" Leatherman explained. ""This house may look good right now because the beach is wide, but wait till that beach narrows up and the waves are hitting the edge of that bluff just below the house.""The 59-year-old's choice to invest in the home is part of a growing trend where buyers opt for scenic properties at high discounts, despite warnings about the possible threats posed by climate change. According to Bloomberg, Moot bought the house at a 67% discount from the seller's original asking price of $1,195 million in 2022.Before buying the property, Moot consulted experts and carefully studied erosion projections for the surrounding area. He also planned and implemented strategies, including planting beach grass to stabilise the sand and considering moving the house further inland. His research led him to believe he could buy some time before the property submerged into the ocean.Experts like Massachusetts state geologist Brian Yellen note that coastlines made of glacial soils, such as those in the eastern US and northern Europe, are particularly vulnerable to shoreline retreat.Moot remains optimistic and hopes to share his dream home with others. He has expressed interest in allowing terminally ill individuals to visit and enjoy the ocean views.

Under the Uttarakhand Compulsory Registration of Marriage Act, non-compliance could not only lead to the loss of benefits but also impose a fine of up to Rs 1,000.In a meeting at Bijapur guest house on Friday, panel members expressed concern over the number of people benefiting from schemes without registering their marriages and highlighted the need for stricter enforcement.A source noted, ""People are receiving scheme benefits without registering their marriages, creating a financial strain on the state. This situation is both objectionable and legally challengeable.""The panel further proposed linking marriage registration with birth and death certificates on the official UCC website to ensure real-time updates and allow verification before disbursing benefits. ""Registering marriages will help verify family units before benefits are extended,"" the source added. While marriage registration laws are already in place, enforcement needs to be tightened, he said.Key officials, including chief secretary Radha Raturi and DGP Abhinav Kumar, attended the meeting. Raturi directed state authorities to cooperate fully with the panel in drafting UCC rules. The panel is expected to submit its report this month, and CM Pushkar Singh Dhami has announced that the UCC will be implemented before Nov 9, which marks Uttarakhand's foundation day.In 2022, in the run-up to the state elections, Dhami pledged to introduce the UCC if re-elected.

Another leaf will be added to the history pages of this rivalry when the two teams meet in their last league match of the Asian Champions Trophy (ACT) in Moqi, China, on Saturday.Both the teams are unbeaten in the tournament so far, but that won't be the correct reflection on their respective form.Defending champions India have won all their four matches, while Pakistan have won two and drawn two to stand behind the India team at No. 2 on the points table.As a result of that, both have already secured a place in the semifinals, while the remaining two spots will be contested between South Korea, Malaysia and hosts China. Japan have been eliminated from the race to the semis.While India and Pakistan contests until the 2014 Asian Games final were mostly fought on a knife's edge, the wins column is heavily loaded in favour of India since then.That point reflects in the fact that Pakistan's last win against India came in 2016 and in the last 16 matches between the two teams, India have won 14 times, while the other two were draws.During the Asian Games in Hangzhou last year, which was the last meeting between the two teams, India secured a resounding 10-2 victory in their pool match.Overall, however, the head-to-head stats are still in favour of Pakistan, but those numbers don't draw the right picture for the hockey fans, as the sport has plunged to a new low in Pakistan, while India have reclaimed their lost spot on the Olympic podium with two consecutive bronze medals in the last two edition of the Games in Paris and Tokyo.Played: 180India won: 66Pakistan won: 82Drawn: 32India's dominance in the ACT is unparalleled, with four titles to their name. They emerged victorious in the final against Malaysia last year in Chennai.Pakistan, with three ACT titles, stand as the second most successful team in the tournament's history."

India has banned the export of non-Basmati white rice since July 20, 2023 to ensure that there is enough rice for domestic consumption and to keep prices down.Later in the day, Union ministry of commerce and industry wrote to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority to convey the decision to remove the MEP for issuing registration-cum-allocation certificates (RCAC) for export of Basmati.Elated over the decision, Punjab Basmati Rice Millers and Exporters Association's vice-president Ranjit Singh Jossan said the move will open global markets for the rice exporters.The milling industry had demanded significant changes in India's rice export policies, including withdrawal of the MEP for Basmati, to ensure that the Indian Basmati industry remains competitive in world markets, he said.On the other hand, Amarjit Sekhon, a Basmati farmer from Amritsar, said Basmati stocks have already started arriving in the Amritsar markets but so far the rates had been down as millers were focussing on carry forward rice from previous season.""The rate was low at Rs 2,700 per quintal. But when the news of the possible reduction of MEP spread, it rose to Rs 3,000 per quintal on Thursday. Last year, we had sold it for upto Rs 3,500 per quintal,"" he said.Earlier, the Centre had reduced the MEP for Basmati from $1,200 to $950 per tonne in October 2023. The MEP was initially imposed to curb illegal shipments of white non-Basmati rice.During a recent meeting in Delhi, the representatives of Punjab Basmati Rice Millers and Exporters Association led by its president Bal Krishan Bali had submitted a formal demand letter to Prahlad Joshi, the Union minister for consumer affairs.India is the leading exporter of Basmati to the world and exported 52,42,048.39 MT of Basmati worth Rs 48,389 crore during 2023-24.Major export destinations include Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab, USA, and Yemen Republic. Two other demands of rice millers are under consideration.These include lifting the export ban on non-Basmati rice and abolishing 20% duty, as well as a separate Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) code for steamed rice."

We had geared ourselves up, and we had trained really well (for the Test),"" Trott said about not getting any play despite bright sunshine on the first two days. ""We were very excited to play against New Zealand and put ourselves up against the challenge. We had played warm-up matches and got ourselves accustomed to the conditions. The thing was we got to train on the square on the days before (the Test), so we even got to see the pitch. Our appetite for this particular game was growing as it neared. So, not being able to play even one day is heartbreaking.""Stead echoed Trott's sentiments. New Zealand wanted to get much-needed match practice ahead of their five World Test Championship (WTC) matches against Sri Lanka (2) and India (3), but that didn't materialise.""The most frustrating part for us is that we lost the opportunity to be match-hardened and match-ready when we go into our Test match against Sri Lanka next week,"" Stead said. ""The guys are really disappointed. It was an opportunity to play Afghanistan. It doesn't come around that often. They have some unique bowlers and it's always good to get your head around how you face them. The way they play is a little bit different from other countries. It's always learning what you can do when you get in those match situations.""Although in few words, Trott expressed his displeasure over the drainage system of the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex.""I hope it is a good learning case (for organisers) that situations can crop up... everything has got to be checked out and made sure that it's ready for Test match cricket. After all, it is Test cricket at the end of the day. And I think sometimes we take it for granted when we go and play. Things have already been done in the past for other nations or other venues - with regards to drainage or ground staff and all those sorts of things,"" Trott said.The former England top-order batsman also rued about the continuous downpour that the city has experienced in the last 10 days.""To try and play a Test match at this time of the year is always tricky. The amount of water that's come down is unprecedented for this time of the year or the last three days. But it would have been nice to play some cricket for sure,"" Trott said.Although the one-off Test wasn't a part of the WTC, Black Caps coach Stead said the format is ""very, very dear to the team's hearts"" and that's why not getting any play was quite ""disheartening"".""We came here to play cricket and play a Test match. Test cricket, certainly to our group of players, is very, very dear to our hearts and every Test you get to play in is a big one. So regardless of whether it has World Test Championship points or not, it was an opportunity to get out there for five days. The surface looked great. The whole block looked fantastic, so it would have been a great match of Test cricket,"" said Stead."

The deceased has been identified as Prashant Kumar , a group D railway employee from Muzaffarpur district in Bihar.According to officials of GRP, Kanpur Central , Prashant got a job on compensatory ground and was posted at Begusarai railway station under Sonpur division of East Central Railway. Police claimed Prashant boarded M1 coach of Barauni-Delhi Humsafar (02563) Clone Express from Muzaffarpur for Delhi on an unreserved ticket, but after being penalised by the ticket examiner, he was given a side lower berth.""Around 2.30 am on Wednesday, the minor girl travelling with her parents, grandmother, and younger brother complained to her mother that Prashant had touched her inappropriately during the journey.

Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/https://sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/closed-door-camp-in-chennai-before-first-test-against-bangladesh/articleshow/113339035.cms,"CHENNAI: It's a new era in Indian cricket and along with it comes new trappings. Gautam Gambhir , the new head coach of the team, had a brief stint with some of the players in Sri Lanka but that was merely an appetizer. Now comes the main course -- a Test series at home against Bangladesh starting in five days' time. And 'Gauti', with his trusted backroom staff of Morne Morkel (bowling coach), Abhishek Nayar (assistant coach) and Ryan ten Doeschate (fielding coach), got down to work with India's seniors under extreme secrecy at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, the venue of the first Test.No media was allowed. Nothing could be filmed or watched. One had to bank on droplets of information filtering out of 'Castle Chepauk' on Friday. Gambhir wanted the entire group together right from the first day, barring Sarfaraz Khan who is playing in the Duleep Trophy. So, Virat Kohli flew in from England late on Thursday night and was among the first to go out on Friday morning and bat against Jasprit Bumrah , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja Day One of training was a long session and all the top-order batters got about 30-45 minutes of batting. The idea, quite clearly, was to get back into game mode after a long vacation which started after the T20 World Cup win in West Indies on June 29 and carried on following a brief Lanka series in early August.Bangladesh, first up at home after a long holiday, are a bit like an unseeded opponent in the first round of a Grand Slam. With a place in the World Test Championship Final in June 2025 up for grabs, the challenge gradually gets tougher in this cycle of 10 Tests over the next five months.After the first two against Bangladesh, who beat Pakistan recently, it's a three-Test series at home against New Zealand followed by five against potential WTC Final opponent Australia in their own backyard. As per rough calculations, India need four wins and a draw from these 10 games to qualify for the WTC Final and Gambhir wants to finish the job before the group tours Down Under. For the first cycle of five home Tests, Gambhir doesn't have to worry too much about the playing XI, but instead about the rotation of his pace bowlers. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj are likely to play at Chepauk while Mohammed Shami is on a comeback trail.Once Shami is ready, Bumrah could be given a break. In all probability, these three will play three games each before the Australia tour while left-arm pacer Yash Dayal can expect a debut sooner rather than later, if he impresses Morkel and Co. with his swing in practice. Bengal's Akash Deep, too, is in the mix and he, too, should be tested somewhere down the line before taking a final call for Australia.Another decision that the new coaching staff has to take is whether to go with KL Rahul or Sarfaraz as the No. 5 batter. While Sarfaraz was a success for India when they played England at home a few months ago, Rahul's class is undeniable. Moreover, Australia are just round the corner and the Karnataka man's sound technique against shortpitched stuff should be something that the team management will keep in mind. The fact that Rahul can be used as an opener adds to his chances, while the occasional wicketkeeping is a bonus as well.There is another area of interest -- the wicketkeeper's slot. Rishabh Pant, by far, is the best in world cricket at the moment but one has to keep in mind that it has only been a few months since his return to top-flight cricket after a life-threatening accident. Whether Pant's body is completely ready for the wear and tear of five-day cricket is something that the management has to take a call on.The fact that Dhruv Jurel, who had an extremely impressive debut series against England, is the back-up, will leave Gambhir spoilt for choice. Gauti, though, is known to be a tough taskmaster and he isn't one who goes by reputation. Even if there's no question about Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and R Ashwin for the first Test, it's important that they all hit the ground running.Gambhir will have his own ideas and it's up to players to execute so that Indian cricket stays on in the cruise mode of the latter part of the Rahul Dravid era."

Captain Dhoni, known for his calm and composed demeanor, displayed visible frustration after this unexpected loss.Badrinath recounted, ""In this match against RCB in Chennai, we were chasing 110 odd runs.We lost wickets in a hurry and we ended up losing the match. It was one of those matches where we couldn't get 110 against RCB in Chepauk.""Badrinath further described an incident in the dressing room after he was dismissed by RCB spinner Anil Kumble ""I got out to a lap shot against Anil Kumble. I got myself LBW. He ( MS Dhoni ) was coming inside the dressing room and I was standing right there. And there was a small water bottle in front of me and MS just kicked it out of the park and I was oh my god!

""My mom was out walking her dog, and she passed by, saw that black cat was severed in half,"" Hime said as quoted by Click2Houston. ""It doesn't look natural to me.""Hime's unsettling observation was corroborated by others who found the mutilated animals. ""It's disgusting. It's frightening,"" Hime continued. ""For this to happen three times in two weeks when we haven't seen anything like this in 30 years, I find it hard to believe that that's just a random animal attack.""The Houston Police Department's Animal Cruelty Unit has reportedly launched an investigation into these macabre incidents. Detectives are treating the cases with heightened urgency, given the brutal nature of the mutilations and the apparent pattern of the incidents.The discovery of the severed cat bodies has sparked fear and outrage among Houston residents. Reports indicate that the mutilated remains were deliberately left in areas frequented by the public, intensifying the sense of horror within the community.The cases have also drawn attention from animal rights advocates and local organizations, who are rallying for increased vigilance and preventive measures.""There's a sense of dread and disbelief in the community,"" said local resident Grizzy Castillo. ""Finding severed and dismembered cats, especially with such precision and care to leave them exposed, is both disturbing and unprecedented in this area.""The investigation is ongoing, with animal cruelty detectives working to determine if the incidents are connected or if they point to a broader issue of animal abuse in the region. Authorities are also considering whether these acts might be part of a larger pattern of cruelty or if they reflect an isolated individual's behavior.The discovery in Houston comes in the wake of another grim finding in San Leon, Texas, where about 50 dead animals, including cats, horses, cows, a raccoon, and dogs, were found on a property, reported Fox26. The investigation was triggered by the search for a missing cat, Cheesecake, which led to the shocking revelation of widespread animal cruelty.""This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life,"" said Kaylee Humburger, whose cat led to the grim finding, was distraught over the condition of the property. Grizzy Castillo, founder of Grizzy Hood News, described the scene as a ""holocaust for cats,"" recounting stepping over dead carcasses and empty food cans. ""We stepped on dead carcass after dead carcass, and kennel after kennel, with dead carcasses with empty cans of food,"" Castillo reported.The property owner, who had been running a trap-and-release (TNR) program with local shelters, is now facing criminal charges. Investigations revealed the owner had a history of animal-related offenses. Neighbors had previously alerted officials about the dire conditions, but the full extent of the cruelty was only recently uncovered.Amid these local tragedies, former President Donald Trump has reignited controversy with his campaign promises. On Friday, Trump vowed to initiate ""large deportations"" from Springfield, Ohio, citing unfounded claims that Haitian migrants there are involved in eating pets. ""We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,""Trump declared, emphasizing his intention to begin with Springfield and Aurora, Colorado. Despite the debunked nature of his claims, Trump's statements have intensified the national debate on immigration and animal cruelty."

They have shared visuals of passengers shouting slogans in protest at the boarding gate in Delhi airport's terminal 3. They were waiting to board SpiceJet flight No. SG 495. ""SpiceJet murdabad, murdabad,"" the passengers were seen shouting, their hands raised. Some of the passengers who have been flying the Delhi-Darbhanga route alleged the airline has been cancelling flights on this route frequently for the last few months. They alleged every other day SpiceJet has been cancelling Delhi-Darbhanga flights just before boarding. This has led to anger building up among passengers, they said. The airline hasn't issued a statement on the matter yet. Last month, the aviation regulator DGCA placed SpiceJet under enhanced surveillance after a recent audit revealed ""certain deficiencies"". The airline has been struggling to fully restore operations despite multiple fund-raises over the last year, trailing rivals IndiGo and Tata-owned Air India in terms of market share. SpiceJet on September 10 announced that Carlyle Group's commercial aviation investment and servicing unit will write off $40.2 million of the airline's lease arrears and convert $30 million of its arrears into equity. The conversion, at Rs 100 ($1.19) per share of SpiceJet, was a 56 per cent premium to its close on September 10.

Despite Easwaran's unbeaten 143, India B trail India C by 216 runs and require 66 more runs to avoid a follow-on with just three wickets in hand. India C had scored a mammoth 525 in their first innings with Ishan Kishan scoring a century. The Day 3 of the tie belonged to the India B skipper, who scored a patient 262-ball 143 amid a procession of wickets with India C pacer Anshul Kamboj's five-wicket haul (5/66 in 23.5 overs) bringing Easwaran's team on its knees. Undaunted by the fall of wickets at the other end, Bengal batter Easwaran kept frustrating the India C bowlers, though he still has work to do on Sunday to avoid a follow-on. Commencing the day at 124 for no loss with Easwaran (overnight 51 not out) and Narayan Jagadeesan (overnight 67 not out) holding fort, India B were rattled quite early when Kamboj struck in only the fourth over of the morning session. The 23-year-old Haryana pacer, who had played a few matches for Mumbai Indians in the IPL last season, got rid of the dangerous Jagadeesan who added just three runs to his personal score, getting the Tamil Nadu batter caught by wicket-keeper Abhishek Porel for 70, thus breaking the 129-run partnership. Kamboj then had brothers Musheer and Sarfaraz Khan cheaply for 1 and 16 runs respectively before accounting for hard-hitter Rinku Singh (6) and Nithis Kumar Reddy (2) to completely destabilise India B. At 194 for 5, things looked bleak for Easwaran's side, but the skipper took it upon himself to shore up his side amid some hostile bowling by Kamboj. He stitched together a 43-run partnership with Washington Sundar (13) and then a 46-run stand with Sai Kishore (21) to repair the damage. At stumps, Rahul Chahar (18 not out) was giving Easwaran company but with just three wickets left, it could be a difficult task for India B to avoid a follow-on. India C skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad could even decide against enforcing a follow-on, given tomorrow is the last day of the contest and they are assured of three vital points on the basis of first innings lead. However, if Gaikwad enforces the follow-on and wins the match, his team will earn six points."

(Representational) Earth's moon will soon have a temporary junior companion, an apparent mini moon revolving around our planet for about two months. In a rare event, an asteroid will be captured by Earth's gravity and will orbit the earth from September 29 to November 25 this year. The asteroid 2024 PT5 was spotted on August 7 using the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded asteroid impact early warning system. According to a report published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, the asteroid is not too big with a diameter of just 10 metre (33 feet). During its 53-day tenure around the earth, 2024 PT5 will not be able to make a full orbit, instead it will perform a horseshoe loop before breaking away from the earth's gravitational pull. The RNAAS report, authored by Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos, says that Earth has a tendency to capture asteroids and pull them into its orbit. These asteroids sometimes perform one or more full revolutions around our planet while other times, they break away from the earth's elliptical path before completing an orbit. In 2006, an asteroid captured by Earth's gravity revolved around it for a year from July 2006 to July 2007. However, the newly discovered 2024 PT5 seems to resemble the path of 2022 NX1, a temporary flyby that revolved around Earth in 1981 and 2022 without ever completing an orbit and will likely return to take another semi round in 2051. While Earth may sometimes pull space junk into its orbit, the report says that 2024 PT5 is a natural object as ""its short-term dynamical evolution closely resembles that of 2022 NX1, a confirmed natural object."" The report also indicates that its orbital properties resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt."

This 36-year-old Brazilian parapsychologist has been celebrated for accurate predictions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, Elon Musk buying Twitter (now X), and the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The latest warning by Salome coincides with the recent confirmation by NASA over the asteroid now dubbed 'God of Chaos.' According to the Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, the gigantic asteroid that Salome had predicted would be a concern in July is expected to come close to Earth this Sunday.

One of the pacers called up for the four-day camp here is Punjab's Gurnoor Brar, who has so far played five first-class matches and he was also with Punjab Kings during the IPL last season. While his first-class record isn't flattering, what worked for the 24-year-old is his tall 6 feet 4.5 inch frame and the disconcerting bounce that he can generate with more than skiddy pace. It is understood that Gurnoor has been drafted in specifically to get some simulation for the high-arm action of Bangladesh pacer Nahid Rana, who had a match-haul of five wickets against Pakistan in a recent Test match at Rawalpindi. The hallmark of Rana's bowling is the bounce he generated from length with his 6ft 5 inch frame and generally bowled straight lines in the second Test against Pakistan. It is understood that with two potent new ball bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj in its ranks, India is unlikely to play on rank turners and the Chepauk strip could be one where pace bowlers and spinners both will get equal assistance. The bounce could be more even and hence the lanky Bangladesh pacer Rana might come into the equation. India's new bowling coach Morne Morkel was seen giving some advice on how to bowl to star batters and what kind of specific net sessions they are looking at in the camp. Mumbai off-spinner Himanshu Singh, whose action is believed to be similar to the legendary Ravichandran Ashwin, is also a part of the nets. Tamil Nadu slow left-arm bowler S Ajit Ram also sweated it out at the nets. Advertisement During the second day at nets, pacers Akash Deep and Yash Dayal, the duo who might have to sit out if India play three specialist spinners, bowled more than the premier pace duo of Bumrah and Siraj. The senior batters are now trying to get into the groove after a month-long break. The Bangladesh team will be arriving in Chennai on Sunday. It is understood that there will be tight security for the visitors, who are coming right after the civil unrest in the country and subsequent ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina. In fact, new BCB chief Farukh Ahmed told reporters in Dhaka last Thursday that BCCI secretary Jay Shah has ""assured"" him necessary security arrangements.

NDTV,https://www.gadgets360.com/internet/news/eu-google-break-up-order-antitrust-action-6564922,"EU antitrust officials are considering ordering Alphabet's Google to end anti-competitive practices in its adtech business, but will not order a breakup as they had previously warned, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. European Union regulators are due to issue a decision with a hefty fine in the coming months after antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last year threatened to break up Google's lucrative adtech business. If this threat had been carried through in what would be a first for an antitrust case, it would have been the harshest regulatory penalty to date against Google, after Vestager charged it with favouring its own advertising services. But competition officials will likely not issue a breakup order because of the complexity involved, the people said. A break-up order could come at a later stage if Google continues its anti-competitive practices, they said, pointing to a precedent setting case involving Microsoft two decades ago. The European Commission's decision could evolve, they added. An EU decision is unlikely to come before Vestager leaves office in November, they said, but is still theoretically possible. The Commission and Google, which has racked up 8.25 billion euros ($9.14 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the last decade, declined to comment. Google's 2023 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $237.85 billion or 77% of total revenues. It is the world's dominant digital advertising platform. Vestager had suggested that Google could sell its sell-side tools DFP and its own ad exchange AdX because of the conflicts of interest as it also owns ad buying tools Google Ads and DV360, which places bids on ad exchanges. She said the company had allegedly illegally favoured its own ad exchange AdX in matching auctions, abusing its dominance since 2014. Google is currently the target of an antitrust trial brought by the U.S. Department of Justice which claims that it sought to monopolise markets for publisher ad servers and advertiser ad networks, and tried to dominate the market for ad exchanges which sit in the middle.

NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-boeing-strike-could-make-the-global-jetliner-shortage-worse-6564811,"Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are assembled at the company's plant in Renton, Washington, US Boeing's first strike in 16 years could further compound global shortages of jetliners that have been pushing up airfares and forcing airlines to keep older jets flying longer, industry executives and analysts said. The US planemaker's West Coast workers went on strike at midnight on Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal, halting production of Boeing's workhorse 737 MAX. It is Boeing's first strike since 2008, and Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West warned a prolonged walkout could hurt output and ""jeopardize our recovery"". ""Boeing is a systemically important company for global aviation,"" Ross O'Connor, chief financial officer of Irish leasing company Avolon, told Reuters on Friday. A strike ""could have an impact on production levels, which could exacerbate some of the supply shortages that are in the market at the moment for sure,"" he said after Avolon announced it had acquired a large portfolio of jets from Castlelake. Airlines have struggled to expand capacity to meet rising demand as supplies of jetliners are curtailed by parts shortages, industry-wide recruitment problems and overloaded maintenance shops. Analysts have been warning the most promising part of the industry's all-important business cycle could run out before airlines have a chance to enjoy the full benefits of demand. ""It's going to be a significant amount of time before we see that balance. I'm starting to evolve the hypothesis that it won't be (extra) supply that corrects it, but instead a softening of demand,"" said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium Ascend. Some say high air fares - although good for airlines in the short term - could themselves accelerate that tipping point. ""My view is that (average fares) will rise; and when ticket prices go up, then all other things being equal, you have lower traffic levels,"" said aviation economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at AVITAS consultancy. As Boeing halts production of its most-sold jet, European rival Airbus is also struggling to meet its goals. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury expressed optimism at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this week that the European planemaker would meet a recently lowered target of 770 deliveries this year, following a profit warning and engine supply glitch in the summer. But following a short-lived spike in deliveries in July, industry sources questioned how comfortably the world's largest planemaker would exceed last year's 735. Dwindling numbers of planes in storage and record-high utilization of existing planes confirm the supply squeeze. FLEET AGE RISING For now, Boeing's lower production levels compared to Airbus may limit the incremental effect of the strike. Yet analysts said airlines have little room to maneuver. With leasing companies also running out of available capacity, carriers need to keep existing jets flying longer. For most of the past 15 years, the average age of the fleet declined as airlines and leasing companies took advantage of low interest rates to invest in new fuel-saving jets. In 2010, the average age of the widely flown single-aisle jet fleet was about 10.2 years, according to Cirium data. After dipping to 9.1 years during the pandemic as airlines grounded fleets, the age started growing again. It now stands at 11.3 years ""and still heading upwards,"" Morris said. That is despite efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050, which rely partly on modernizing the planes in service. ""It must mean that we're burning more CO2 than we should be because we're using more old aircraft...so one of the things that can go wrong is sustainability,"" Morris said. The airline industry says it is confident of reaching a target of net zero emissions by 2050.

Three persons, including the victim's brother-in-law Gogula Srikanth , 34, Puliashramane Anand, 35 and Ambati Venkatesh, 23 were arrested by the police. The victim, Maddasani Yashwanth, 25, was found dead in his hostel room in Gachibowli, Hyderabad, on September 2. Initially, the incident was believed to be a suicide, but the police, sensing foul play, delved deeper into the case. During the investigation, police identified Gogula Srikanth, the brother-in-law of the deceased, as the prime suspect. It was discovered that Srikanth, driven by financial desperation, had hired two assassins, Anand and Venkatesh, to carry out the murder. The trio made the crime appear as a suicide. According to the police, Srikanth was running a men's hostel in partnership at Gachibowli. Yashwanth, after completing his studies, was residing in one of the hostel rooms duly looking for job opportunities. Srikanth was heavily indebted due to online gambling and saw Yashwanth's death as a way to gain access to his family's assets and repay his debts to the tune of Rs4 crore. He hired the two hitmen by paying them Rs10 lakh, disconnected the CCTV power supply and entered Yashwanth's room while he was asleep. The two men entered the hostel room between 12.45 a.m. - 1.30 a.m. and strangled the victim to death and later hanged his body with a cloth to make it appear like a suicide, the police explained."

In keeping with tradition, the Thiruvonathoni, a sacred vessel carrying vegetables, provisions, and other items for the Onam feast (Onasadya) at Sree Parthasarathy Temple, began its journey on Saturday. The boat set sail from the Mahavishnu temple ghats in Kattoor under the leadership of Anoop Narayanan Bhattathiri, a member of the Mangattu Illam family in Kumaranallur. The voyage commenced around 6 p.m. with offerings made by 18 Nair families in the village, as per custom. Along its route, the canoe was accorded reception at Ayroor and Vechoor Mana in Melukara. The vessel is expected to reach the Aranmula Parthasarathy temple ghats by Sunday morning. Once there, the feast will be prepared in the temple kitchen and served to devotees in the dining hall. Legend has it that the deity of the Sree Parthasarathy temple once made an elder from the Kattoor Madom (in Pathanamthitta) his host for the Onam feast, impressed by his devotion. Since then, it has been the privilege of the eldest Bhattathiri of the Mangattu Illam to carry on this sacred duty and host the deity's Onam feast each year. Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the grand regatta of the palliyodams (snakeboats) on September 18, an annual event marking the anniversary of the idol installation at the centuries-old temple. Known as the oldest boat race in Kerala, this water carnival attracts thousands of spectators. A meeting led by Health Minister and Aranmula legislator Veena George has outlined a comprehensive action plan involving various government departments to ensure the smooth conduct of the event. A security team comprising 650 police personnel will be deployed to maintain law and order, while boat patrolling will be intensified in collaboration with the Palliyoda Seva Sangham, the organising committee of the regatta. The Pampa Irrigation Project has been tasked with ensuring that water levels in the Pampa River are adequate for the event. In addition, the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will operate extra services from depots across the district, including Chengannur. A massive clean-up drive has also been launched with the cooperation of four local bodies-- Mallappuzhassery, Thottappuzhassery, Aranmula, and Koipram"

Sources at the Kozhikode Corporation has confirmed that the Foundation has chosen Thiruvananthapuram Corporation for the project which it had planned to set up with the support of Habitat Charitable Trust. Kozhikode Mayor Beena Philip said that the Corporation was yet to receive any official communication in this regard and alleged a deep rooted conspiracy at the official level which resulted in the city losing the much awaited project. The 200 KLD (0.2 MLD) FSTP was to be set up next to the Sewage Treatment Plant that was to come up at Karimbanapalam near Sarovaram Bio Park in Kozhikode. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in association with Ankur Scientific Energy Private Limited, is setting up an 'Omni Processor' facility for the treatment of faecal sludge worldwide, with an aim to promote water hygiene. The proposed FSTP at Sarovaram was part of the programme. The Kozhikode Corporation was all in with the proposal as it will not impose any financial burden on the Corporation. The size of the STP at Sarovaram was reduced to 13.5 MLD from 27 MLD to accommodate the FSTP in the 2.6 acre compound. The FSTP was to be connected to the STP and was supposed to cater to 10 wards of the Corporation. Mayor Beena Philip expressed disappointment over losing the project despite making every effort possible. ""We were apprehensive about the delay on the part of the Foundation in confirming the project, after we obtained all required clearance"", she told The Hindu on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Corporation's United Democratic Front councillors accused the Corporation of not showing much interest in the project in the first place.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bihar/reality-bites/article68629435.ece,"On an early muggy monsoon morning in August, Suman Devi, 30, heard a loud scream. She ran out to the veranda of her straw-and-mud house to find her husband Manoj Ram, 35, clutching his left leg. Suman's mouth went dry. ""I rushed to call my relative from an adjacent house,"" she says, heavily, at her home in Dubwalia village, Phulwaria block in Gopalganj district of north Bihar. Chhabila Ram, her husband's uncle, came back with her. Soon, Manoj's cousin Satyendra Kumar Ram and other villagers put him on a motorcycle to ride to the local Primary Health Centre (PHC) three kilometres away. There, doctors referred him to the district hospital in Gopalganj, some 35 km away. Doctors there could not revive Manoj and said he needed better, urgent care, says Suman. As a statistic, Manoj Ram is just another snakebite victim. Incidents such as these are so common that local doctors, the administration, and news reporters do not flinch when they occur. But for Suman and her two children, 10 and 7, the loss is unbearable. Suman replays a scene in her head, her forehead scrunched and eyes clouded: ""It was a rainy night. Perhaps that's why the snake found its way into our house."" Snakes seek refuge in homes during the rains, when the holes they live in fill with water. ""Maybe my husband put his feet down from the cot right onto it, and it bit him,"" she wonders. Her children stare at strangers in the house, unable to cry. They are both in the village government school. The village is a few kilometres from former Parliamentarian and Bihar Chief Minister Rashtriya Janata Dal patriarch Lalu Prasad's hometown. The block's Marachhiya Devi Referral Hospital is named after his mother. ""If the PHC had basic anti-venom medicines or some other primary health treatment ready, my nephew would have been alive today,"" Chhabila Ram says, sitting on a rope-strung cot in the courtyard, along with relatives and other villagers who have gathered to mourn the death of Manoj. They say the government must urgently look at improving basic facilities in the PHC, considering snakebites are common in the area during the rainy season that stretches from July to August. At the Gopalganj Sadar district hospital, where Manoj was taken, Dr. Niraj Chaturvedi asserts that the health facility has enough anti-venom medicine, but that treatment must be administered without delay or the bite can be fatal. ""We get about 150 cases of snakebite in a month at the hospital during the monsoon and summer seasons when snakes, looking for shelter, encroach upon human dwellings,"" he says. This year, in Bihar, 14 people died in the heat wave in a day in May, as per Bihar's Disaster Management Department. In temperatures so high, snakes cannot survive in holes and find comfort in people's homes. Dr. Chaturvedi adds that 80% of snakebites are non-poisonous, but Bihar's riverine areas, mostly in the northern part of the State, host many poisonous snakes like krait, cobra, and pit viper. A vial of anti-venom medicine costs Rs800 in Bihar, though at a government hospital, this is administered free of cost. About eight vials are needed for treatment that must preferably be administered within 30 minutes of the bite, says the doctor. The vials must be kept in ice boxes with the cold chain maintained. Snakebites are a disease of poverty, primarily affecting communities in villages that do not have access to brick-and-mortar houses. In March this year, Babita Devi, from Pakri-Dumri village in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district lost her husband, Tunnu Manjhi, 30, to snakebite, leaving the family's responsibilities solely on her. The family of agricultural labourers is already struggling with employment, and has sunk even deeper into poverty. Voices of the vulnerable About 50 km away, at Kahla village, Barauli block in the same district of Gopalganj, Pradip Prasad, 30, bears the weight of the death of his seven-year-old son Aditya Kumar. Pradip, who works as a labourer in Panipat, Haryana, rues, ""If I had been here, at least I would have seen my son before he died."" Pradip has shaved his head following the death ritual of his community of Scheduled Castes (SCs). The 2022 Bihar caste-based survey showed that poverty was highest among the Dalit community (SCs, 19.65% of the total population), with 42.93% being economically categorised as poor. He has been laying pipelines for the last six to seven years in Haryana, while his wife, with their son and daughter, live in the village with other relatives. Two of his brothers are agricultural labourers in the village. It took him 36 hours of changing several buses, and two days, to reach home once he found out his son had been bitten, in August this year. Aditya had just come back from school and was playing with his friends outside their newly constructed half-brick-half-thatch home. ""Their ball fell on a coiled snake on the side of the road and bit Aditya on his little finger on the right hand, when he reached to pick it up,"" he says, having heard the story from his son's friends. The snake had slithered away, and Aditya had fallen unconscious. His friends had shouted for help and soon relatives and villagers first took him to the Barauli hospital, some three km away from the village. Again, doctors referred him to the Gopalganj town hospital for further treatment, where he soon died. Aditya's three-year-old sister is unaware of what is happening and wonders why her brother is not there to play with her. She slips out of her father's arms and runs into the house, to her mother. Pradip excuses himself. Minutes later, there's the sound of wailing. A study published in the Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health journal in 2020, showed that 30% of snakebites occurred when people are asleep, another 30% during play, and 28% during field or other outdoor activities. Superstition around snakebite is common in Bihar. Despite doctors declaring him dead, relatives took Aditya's body to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh about 14 km away. ""We went to several temples and exorcists to revive him, but nothing worked,"" Jitendra Patel, the child's grandfather recounts. ""There was no post-mortem done at the hospital, no anti-venom medicine, no doctor was in proper doctor's coat,"" he said. Villagers claim that while the building of the district hospital exists, there have been several stories of medical negligence and patients being treated poorly. In another incident in July 2024, Santosh Lohar from Nawada district was sleeping at his base camp after a day's hard work of laying railway lines when a snake bit him. He was quickly taken to Rajauli subdivision hospital by his colleagues, and his life was saved. However, there is a belief here that biting a snake back neutralises the venom in the human body. Santosh did just that, killing the snake. Snakebites and Parliament On July 29, the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Saran Lok Sabha constituency, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, raised the issue of snakebite deaths in Parliament. He said 10,000 of the 50,000 annual snakebite deaths in India happen in Bihar. Citing a NITI Aayog report, Rudy said Bihar suffers from both ""poverty and natural calamities"", escalating its risk. He expressed gratitude to the Irula community of Tamil Nadu who produce snakebite venom as an antidote. He added, ""Due to regional genetic differences, this venom is not effective everywhere."" The BJP MP further criticised the lack of snakebite prevention measures across India and demanded ""immediate government action"". In March this year, the Central government had launched the Snakebite Helpline (15400) under its One Health approach, as one of measures to halve snakebite deaths by 2030. In 2023, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed global snakebite deaths stood at 1.3 lakh, with triple the number of amputations and permanent disabilities from bites. In 2017, WHO had reinstated snakebite envenoming (venom entering the blood stream) as a neglected tropical disease. Up to 70% of snakebite envenoming in the world occurs in South Asia. Dr. Chaturvedi, in the Gopalganj hospital, says northern Bihar districts see the highest numbers in the State due to ""extreme weather conditions: heatwaves, prolonged dry spells, floods"". Land converted to fields for farming, ensures a hospitable environment for snakes. ""Rats and other small animals are good food for the snakes,"" he says. Several rivers like the Sarayu and Bagmati water the area, but when they flood, they carry the reptiles into human habitation. On March 31, 2022, Bihar's then Deputy Chief Minister, Renu Devi, who also handled disaster management, had announced in the State Assembly: ""If any person ever dies due to snakebite in the State, the government will provide an ex gratia of Rs4 lakh to the next of kin."" Death due to snakebite was also included in the list of disasters of local nature. However, at the Goplaganj administrative office, no one has any information of snakebite death compensation. Sandeep Kumar, an official at the State's Disaster Management Disaster Management Department, does not have any information either. ""You better contact the Health Department for this,"" he says. The Health Department says it is not their problem and they have no records. Neither responded to queries on death by snakebite or medicines available. Most often, as in the case of Suman, Babita, and Prasad, since there is no post-mortem report or death certificate from the hospital -- both essential documents to claim the ex gratia amount -- they simply cannot access the money."

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Konaseema District Collector R. Mahesh Kumar has issued an order for the probe. The State government-constituted medical boards are entitled to issue the certificate of disability, based on which the government sanctions a monthly pension to eligible applicants. The medical pension is given in two categories: Rs15,000 for those who are completely bedridden and Rs6,000 for those with partial disability. Mr. Mahesh Kumar said 668 individuals are receiving the disability pension in the district as of September and 281 of them have been getting the Rs15,000 monthly aid by obtaining complete disability certificates from four medical boards -- Kakinada, Rajole, Amalapuram and Rajamahendravaram. However, the 281 individuals are only eligible to get a monthly pension of Rs6,000 (for partial disability). The fake disability certificates and the claims by the beneficiaries were exposed during a month-long official investigation conducted by a five teams of doctors constituted for the purpose. Pension cancelled ""As many as 26 individuals, who claimed complete disability and received Rs15,000 monthly aid, are not eligible to get any disability pension. A detailed inquiry will be done with the medical boards to initiate stringent action against the doctors responsible for issuing the fake disability certificates,"" said Mr. Mahesh Kumar. The process to cancel all the 26 disability pensions has begun, and the Collector has submitted a report on the fake certificates to higher authorities for further action.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-species-of-dung-beetle-discovered-in-hesaraghatta-grasslands/article68642233.ece,"Often in the headlines due to threats to its existence, the Hesaraghatta grasslands, located in the catchment area of Hesaraghatta lake in northwest Bengaluru, are well-known among ecologists for their rich biodiversity. These grasslands support a diverse array of species and provide essential ecosystem services, particularly as an important grazing ground for the livestock of local communities. Entomologists from the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) have now discovered a new species of dung beetle, Onitis visthara, further emphasising the urgent need for the conservation of the grassland ecosystem. Importance of dung beetles According to a release from ATREE, an average cow produces approximately 30 kg of dung daily, amounting to over 10 tons per year. With India having the world's largest livestock population, exceeding 535 million heads, the amount of excrement produced is substantial and plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling. ""A significant portion of this dung is processed and decomposed by dung beetles, which belong to the family Scarabaeidae. These beetles feed, breed, and nest in the dung, either burying it or breeding directly within the dung pats,"" said the release. This finding is part of a broader effort to revise the taxonomy of the genus Onitis in the Indian subcontinent, during which two other new species were also discovered: Onitis kethai from Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve, Karnataka, and Onitis bhomorensis from Tezpur, Assam. ""Cattle dung is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing significantly to climate change. However, by burying the dung, dung beetles help reduce these emissions. Additionally, these beetles enhance nutrient cycling, improve soil aeration, aid in secondary seed dispersal, and help control parasites,"" said Seena Karimbumkara, researcher and lead author. Along with researcher Priyadarsanan Dharma Rajan, she has been studying dung beetles for over 20 years and conducted an extensive study to complete a monographic revision of the Onitis genus of the Indian Subcontinent. A rare genus Onitis is a relatively rare genus of dung beetles found in the Afrotropical, Oriental, and Palaearctic regions. Before the discovery of the three new species, only 176 species of Onitis had been reported globally. All species of this genus are tunnellers, meaning they bury large quantities of cattle dung beneath the dung pat to provide food for their larvae. ""Onitis visthara is broader compared to other Onitis species. So it is named visthara, which means breadth in Kannada, while O. kethai is named after our field assistant, the late Ketha Gouda, and Onitis bhomorensis is named after the bridge ""Kolia Bhomora"" across Brahmaputra, from where the new species was collected,"" added the release. Pressure on green spaces Priyadarsanan Dharma Rajan, who leads the insect lab at ATREE, said, ""Rapid urbanisation, along with growing industrial and commercial activities, has placed tremendous pressure on urban green spaces. Bengaluru's natural landscape was once dominated by dry deciduous trees, interspersed with wetlands and open grasslands. The Hesaraghatta grasslands and the nearby Avalahalli forests are among the few remaining patches of this original vegetation. Given their rich biodiversity and the valuable ecosystem services they provide, these landscapes should be protected as a biodiversity heritage of Bengaluru."""

Laxman flayed Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy for his reported decision to not attend the Telangana Liberation Day celebrations to be held in the city on September 17. This decision is due to pressure from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), he alleged. Speaking to the media after inspecting the arrangements for the Liberation Day fete at Parade Ground on Saturday, Mr. Laxman expressed regret over the government's call to skip the event, which is being officially organised by the Central government for the past three years. Comparing Mr. Revanth Reddy with former CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr. Laxman said that both KCR and Mr. Revanth Reddy ""act under the influence of the MIM"". He questioned the government's reluctance to fully embrace Telangana Liberation Day, likening its importance to Independence Day and calling for its inclusion in school curricula. He also called for the preservation of historic sites linked to Telangana's struggle against the Razakars, urging that places such as Parkal and Byranpalli be converted into inspirational centres and museums. The BJP leader highlighted the Centre's commitment to showcasing the history of Telangana's liberation, with the Union Ministry of Culture organising a parade and cultural programmes at Parade Ground on September 17. Mr. Laxman warned that people would not tolerate any political appeasement over the State's legacy. Former MLAs Chintala Ramachandra Reddy and Prem Singh Rathore were also present."
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/post-glacial-ecosystems-could-help-slow-down-climate-change-study/article68633976.ece,"The retreat of glaciers may be one of the most evident signs of climate change, but it will leave behind new ecosystems that could help mitigate climate change, says a global study titled 'The Development of Terrestrial Ecosystems Emerging After Glacier Retreat'. The study, published in multidisciplinary science journal Nature, suggests that deglaciation may accelerate climate change by reducing surface reflectivity and releasing stored carbon, but the post-glacial ecosystems could help slow it down. The study, led by professor Gentile Francesco Ficetola from the University of Milan and Silvio Marta from Italy's Institute of Geosciences and Earth Resources, is the result of a decade-long investigation into how ecosystems develop in glacial retreat areas. Their findings show how ecosystems develop in these areas and suggest that proper management could boost biogeochemical processes, aiding in climate change mitigation. The study involved collecting more than 1,200 soil samples from nearly fifty glaciers worldwide, spanning diverse climates from tropical to subpolar regions. Dr. Pritam Chand of Central University, Punjab, along with professor Milap Chand Sharma of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, contributed to this study by analysing samples from the Gangotri and Bara Shigri glaciers in the Indian Himalayas. These samples were analysed to understand soil evolution, biodiversity, species arrival sequence and ecosystem development. Pointing out that immediately after glacier retreat, microorganisms such as bacteria, protists and algae are the first to colonise the barren landscape, making minerals available for other species, Mr. Pritam Chand said that within a decade, hardy plants like lichens, mosses and grass begin to establish, enriching the soil and paving the way for more complex plant life and larger animals. ""This research is both scientifically significant and societally relevant, as it underscores the importance of these emerging ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Post-glacial ecosystems could help slow down climate change through carbon capture and storage through growing biogeochemical processes and biomass,"" Mr. Pritam Chand told The Hindu. He said as more areas become deglaciated, especially in the Himalayas and sub-polar regions, managing these new ecosystems will be vital. ""With proper management, these areas can develop rapidly, providing temporary habitats for species threatened by climate change. Though recently exposed, deglaciated terrains are crucial for biodiversity and could serve as refuges for cold-adapted species. Promoting wild herbivores could further enhance life in these regions and help mitigate climate change impacts,"" he said. Mr. Pritam Chand said that in India, studying the development of terrestrial ecosystems after glacier retreat is crucial, particularly in the Himalayas. He said these ecosystems regulate water availability, impacting rivers that support millions of people with drinking water, agriculture and hydropower. ""Additionally, the biodiversity in these areas offers potential for medicinal and agricultural discoveries, while promoting eco-tourism to boost local economies.

The college came under affiliation of Bharathiar University during 1982-83, and was accorded autonomous status during 1987-88. Since then it is consistently among the top three government colleges in Tamil Nadu, which the Principal, M.R. Yezhili, and faculty attribute to the emphasis on co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, including sports, to ensure multi-dimensional personality development of the learners. The Institutional Data submitted by the college for NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) 2024 states that there are 5,235 students in the UG programmes, and 1,232 students in the PG programmes. All the students, pursuing any of the 22 UG or 21 PG courses, receive full tuition fee reimbursement from the State and Central governments. The UGC communication, issued last month to Bharathiar University, says that the UGC, in its meeting held on January 1 this year, approved the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Autonomous Colleges to extend the autonomous status to Government Arts College, Coimbatore, from the academic year 2023-24 to 2027-2028."

A two-day conclave is planned in the first week of October in Bengaluru and its main agenda will be to ensure justice in vertical and horizontal devolution of taxes to States by the Centre. Who are to be invited Following the alleged discriminatory approach by the Centre in the devolution of funds to States that contribute more to the Central pool of taxes, the Karnataka government has decided to invite the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Delhi, and Punjab, which are contributing more revenue to the Central pool but receiving a lower share. The conclave will seek an increase in the vertical devolution from the present 41% to 50% to States. Karnataka has been demanding an increase in the share of States from the present 50% to 60% since ""the State governments are putting a lot of efforts in the mobilisation of tax revenues"". Moreover, States are implementing many social welfare measures for the upliftment of the economically disadvantaged. ""The States need to spend huge amounts of funds for the development of infrastructure,"" said Basavaraja Rayaraddi, MLA and economic adviser to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. During the Value Added Tax (VAT) regime, States had their own tax resource base and they need not had to depend on the Centre. But in the GST regime, States are dependent on the Centre and the ratio of division (50:50) is not favourable to States. ""There should be a rethink on the ratio of division,"" he said. The economic adviser, who has taken the initiative to host the event, said Mr. Siddaramaiah would invite the Chief Ministers of 10-12 States for the summit. Later, he and Revenue Minister Krishna Byre Gowda would personally visit them, Mr. Rayaraddi said. Unlike in Kerala Unlike Kerala, which hosted a summit of only five Opposition-ruled States on September 12, Karnataka wants to invite States, irrespective of parties that are in power there, to create a national consensus on devolution of more taxes to States that are contributing more to the Central pool, Mr. Rayaraddi said. Karnataka contributes annually about Rs4.6 lakh crore but it received Rs50,257 crore, including grants, from the Centre during 2023-24. The 15th Finance Commission in its award period (2020-21 to 2025-26) has dragged Karnataka's share (horizontal devolution) down from 4.71% in the 14th FC to 3.64%. Due to this, the State will lose Rs62,098 crore during the 15th FC period. Karnataka's demand is to increase the devolution from 3.64% to 5% in the 16th FC award period. Karnataka gets back 0.29 paise for every rupee it contributes to the Central pool of taxes while Bihar gets back Rs7.06 and Uttar Pradesh Rs2.73, the State has pointed out. Currently, the Centre does not share cess and surcharges collected from States. Karnataka has been requesting the Centre to bring cess and surcharges under the divisible pool. In 2022-23, the Centre had collected about Rs5 lakh crore in the form of cess and surcharge. By denying the share, Karnataka has been losing Rs7,780 crore a year, Mr. Rayaraddi said. ""The conclave will be a crucial platform for bargaining the need to overhaul Centre-State financial ties and to present these concerns to the 16th FC,"" he said. Experts in the fields would be invited. On August 29, the 16th FC headed by Arvind Panagariya held a round of talks with the Karnataka government. The FC's award period will commence on April 1, 2026."

The Excise seized 20 litres of suspected arrack from their vehicles and rented home. About 950 litres of 'wash' and equipment used for making arrack such as five gas cylinders and four pressure cookers, 700 plastic bottles for selling arrack, and a bottle sealing item were seized. An autorickshaw, a car, and two smartphones used for sale were also recovered. The arrested are Santhosh, 54, of Pookkattupady and Kiran Kumar, 35, of Kakkanad. They were nabbed in a joint raid conducted by the State Excise Enforcement Squad, Excise Intelligence, and the Ernakulam Excise Range. They were allegedly engaged in illicit brewing on an industrial scale by taking a house on rent at Thevakkal near Kakkanad in the guise of making 'Kulukki Sarbath'. According to Excise officials, they used to sell arrack against pre-received orders and it was much in demand. Santhosh invested in the illicit trade while Kiran found the clients. During interrogation, they reportedly named Laibin of Mattancherry, reportedly infamous for illicit brewing. He has also been arraigned as accused. A week earlier, Excise officials had arrested three, including a woman, accused of selling illicit liquor on the pretext of selling traditional medicines. The investigation into that case led to the latest arrests. The two had been under surveillance for a while before Kiran was nabbed while reportedly waiting for clients in an autorickshaw near Bharata Mata College.

Deeming this period insufficient, the Delhi High Court has directed the Union government to review its guidelines on the matter. ""This period of six weeks envisaged under the Guidelines to enable a female candidate to regain her medical fitness after going through a pregnancy, in our considered opinion, is extremely short,"" said a Bench of Justice Rekha Palli and Justice Shalinder Kaur. They noted that ""it may not always be possible for a female candidate, who has undergone a pregnancy, to regain her complete medical fitness and lose the weight within six weeks which she may have gained during nine months of her pregnancy"". Even under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, a much longer period of absence from duty has been envisaged, the court said. BMI too high The court's observations came while hearing the plea of a young mother aspiring to join the Seema Sashastra Bal (SSB) as a Constable (Washer Man)-Female. After passing physical endurance and standards tests, she sat for a written test on June 22, 2023. Her name appeared in the merit list when the final results were declared on November 21, 2023. Due to her advanced pregnancy, however, her medical examination was deferred until after delivery. She delivered a baby on February 24 this year and underwent a medical exam on July 11, where she was declared unfit for being overweight. A subsequent Review Medical Board on July 15 also found her unfit, due to a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25.3, exceeding the CAPFs' acceptable limit of 25. She then obtained a medical fitness certificate from the Jaya Arogya Hospital in Gwalior, showing a BMI of 24.8, and submitted a representation requesting her appointment. Receiving no response, she filed a petition before the court. Reasonable time frame needed The court said it had no reason to doubt the Centre's statement that the woman's BMI was above 25 during the selection process,. However, it added: ""We are of the considered view that taking into account the admitted position that the petitioner had delivered a baby barely four months before she was medically examined, she deserves to be granted another opportunity to be examined by a fresh Medical Board as she is reported to having achieved a BMI of less than 25 as per the certificate issued by JA Hospital, a government hospital in Gwalior."" In case the woman's BMI is found to be less than 25, she is to be given her appointment, the court said in a September 10 order. The court also asked the Centre to examine this provision in consultation with concerned medical specialists, and to consider providing a reasonable time frame for a female candidate to regain her medical fitness after a pregnancy."

The bustling pre-festival activity, known locally as 'Uthrada Pachil,' was particularly visible in the iconic marketplaces of S.M. Street in Kozhikode, Broadway in Kochi, and Chala Market in Thiruvananthapuram. These areas were teeming with people eager to gather the ingredients for their traditional Onam feasts to be prepared on the Thiruvonam day on Sunday. Queues snaked outside confectionery outlets where customers eagerly awaited their turn to buy payasam, bolis, and banana chips--essential components of the Onam spread. Despite the State government's decision to cancel official celebrations due to the devastating landslide in Wayanad, the festive spirit seemed to be alive and well. Families flocked to malls, electronics stores, and textile showrooms, hunting for last-minute bargains as the clock ticked down to the holiday. Street vendors were out in force, offering an array of products including clothes, toys, trinkets, glass bangles, and imitation gold ornaments. Meanwhile, upscale malls and car showrooms transformed into Onam wonderlands, complete with Mahabali-themed decorations and performances of traditional art forms like Kathakali, Theyyam, and Chanda Melam, adding to the festive ambience. The soaring prices of essential commodities and perishables might have driven the rates of Onam sadyas up, but there appears to be no let-up in demand. Caterers and restaurants are offering elaborate Onam meals, featuring over 15 items including various payasams, with prices starting from Rs200. In recent years, many households have turned to caterers to relish the traditional sadyas, with some opting for smaller packages of around five meals instead of preparing the feast at home. According to K.K. Kabeer, secretary of the All Kerala Caterers Association, this trend has significantly boosted the food business during the Onam season. He, however, emphasised the need for strict regulatory oversight to ensure that only agencies with FSSAI licenses and high hygiene standards are allowed to operate. Flower businesses that typically thrive during the festive season have taken a hit due to the recent landslides in Wayanad. This has impacted large sections, including flower farmers in Kerala and bordering parts of Tamil Nadu, this year. S. Sreekumaran Nair, a flower merchant based in Thiruvananthapuram's Chala and an office-bearer of the florists association, explains that the subdued celebrations across educational institutions, government and private establishments, prompted by the tragedy, have led to decreased demand for flowers. ""Sadly, large quantities of flowers brought from places as far as Thovala and Dindigul are expected to rot with few buyers turning up with bulk orders. Nonetheless, we have individuals purchasing small quantities for their homes,"" he said."

His family were in the ambulance carrying the body, while supporters and CPI (M) leaders marched from the party office to Jantar Mantar, the streets once again drowning in chants of 'Lal Salaam'. The CPI(M) general secretary died on Thursday (September 12, 2024) at a hospital here after battling a lung infection. Yechury, 72, was in a critical condition for the last few days and on respiratory support while undergoing treatment for an acute respiratory tract infection at the ICU in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). He was admitted to the hospital on August 19. On Friday (September 13, 2024), Yechury's body was taken to the Jawaharlal Nehru University from the AIIMS where hundreds of students and faculty members paid their last respects to him. As a student at the JNU, Yechury was a part of the Students Federation of India (SFI), which he joined in 1974 and was arrested a few months later during the Emergency. He served as the president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) thrice during 1977-78. Later, the body was taken to his residence where senior CPI(M) leaders paid tributes to their comrade. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda had also paid his last respects to the leader at his residence on Friday evening. Yechury is survived by his wife Seema Chishti and his two children Akhila and Danish. His elder son, Ashish Yechury, passed away due to Covid in 2021. Yechury was earlier married to Indrani Mazumdar."

""As discussed in the media, we have not sent any official invitation to any political parties so far,"" he affirmed. When asked whether DMK would be invited for the conference, Mr. Thirumavalavan said, all parties who support complete prohibition would be invited and both DMK and AIADMK have expressed their willingness for prohibition of alcohol in the State. He emphasized that they had no idea of inviting PMK and BJP for the conference as they were parties whose fundamental politics were caste and religion. ""The bitter experience we have gained in travelling along with PMK for five years is one of the major reasons for not inviting them. Also, this is the unanimous decision our party's high committee,"" he noted."

The fee, once implemented, is intended to support maintenance costs and ensure the facilities remain in good condition. The Corporation has established 16 indoor sports complexes across Coimbatore's five zones: one in Central, three in north, eight in south, two in west, and two in east. These facilities primarily have a badminton court and gym floor. The civic body plans to auction maintenance contracts to enhance upkeep. In some areas, local residents and welfare associations have taken the initiative to maintain the facilities. The indoor sports complex in Muthukumar Nagar, Central Zone, is maintained by local sports enthusiasts. D. Balasubramaniam, a resident of P.M. Swamy Colony, explained, ""When the complex was built in 2018, it lacked sufficient lighting and badminton poles. To address this, around 30 regular badminton players pooled in resources to add lights, install nets, paint, and replace the wooden court, spending nearly Rs3 lakh. Given the high maintenance costs for a badminton court, it remains to be seen how effectively the private sector can maintain the facility with just Rs75 a month."" In Ward 12, the Rakachi Garden Residents' Welfare Association has engaged a local badminton coach to train about 70 students, each paying Rs100 a month. Ward Councillor V. Ramamoorthy expressed concern that, ""handing over maintenance to private contractors could lead to a focus on profit rather than proper upkeep."" G. Sampath, a frequent user of the Corporation's indoor sports complex, said, ""It is a welcome move by the Corporation. Considering that private badminton courts charge Rs100 per hour, a monthly fee of Rs75 is appreciable."" Mayor R. Ranganayaki said, ""Not all the complexes are maintained by local residents. We will inspect each complex and hold a meeting to discuss practical implementation after gathering feedback from the respective residents' associations. The monthly fee of Rs 75 is planned to encourage greater participation from lower income groups. Additionally, there is a proposal to build another facility in R.S. Puram."""""

The meeting further noted Kerala's successful Gulf worker welfare model as an example for Telangana. The proposed committee will study and recommend welfare measures for Gulf workers, including introducing a Gulf insurance scheme, similar to the Rythu Bima, and safeguards against exploitation by manpower export companies. The meeting proposed that the government provide ex-gratia of Rs5 lakh to the families of workers who have died in Gulf countries, starting from December 7, 2023. Additionally, the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee's (TPCC) NRI Cell urged the government to offer Rs 1 lakh as ex-gratia to the families of workers who died before December 7, 2023. It was also proposed that special counters for Gulf workers be established at the 'Prajavani' (public grievance redressal meetings) held at Praja Bhavan in Hyderabad, starting on September 20. Addressing the meeting, Minister Prabhakar emphasized that these measures would significantly improve the welfare of Gulf workers and their families. He also assured that 100% admissions would be guaranteed for the children of Gulf workers in government-run Gurukul (residential) schools and colleges, ensuring better access to education. Government Whip and Vemulawada MLA Adi Srinivas mentioned that his constituency had already extended ex-gratia payments to the families of two Gulf worker victims through the Chief Minister's Relief Fund (CMRF), setting a precedent for future support. The meeting also highlighted concerns about workers in other countries, including Singapore and Malaysia, who face similar challenges. Participants stressed the importance of including workers from these regions in welfare programmes.

Following the criticism the Salem Division of Southern Railways faced after altering the more than 125-year-old heritage railway station in Coonoor, and also facing flack for paving a wetland surrounding the railway station in Udhagamandalam, the Railways said, ""These areas are not wetlands as presumed by some people; it would not have been possible for the erstwhile railway engineers to construct NMR on wetlands. The fact that these are not wetlands has also been confirmed by the Nilgiris district administration and their revenue records as well,"" they said. The Tamil Nadu State Wetland Authority (TNSWA) said in November of 2023 that the wetland adjacent to the railway station in Udhagamandalam was being severely degraded by the construction of a parking lot in violation of the orders of the Madras High Court. Until ground-truthing was completed, and wetlands are notified under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, it should be protected from being degraded by construction and ""development"" activities, the Authority had said. """"This kind of deliberate act of conversion of swamps, marshes and natural lakes, which are natural sponges for groundwater recharge, water purification, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, needs to be stopped in the larger public interest and penal action should be initiated against the irresponsible officials of the concerned government departments and others as per the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,"" the letter added. Several conservationists from the Nilgiris have inspected the area surrounding the Udhagamandalam railway station. An ecological assessment of the area by one ecologist, says, ""This wetland has been partially degraded by various anthropogenic disturbances, such as building construction, drainage systems, land modification, and grazing by horses and cows. As a result, some areas of the wetland have been converted into grassland or grazing land. However, there is a stagnant water habitat that supports a large population of native species."" The assessment went on to add that currently, the wetland was connected to a local drainage system. ""Interestingly, this wetland has a huge population of Acorus calamus L. (Acoraceae). It is a unique plant preferred in swamps or wetlands only. In Nilgiris, the population of Acorus calamus is reduced due to habitat destruction, degradation, and conversion to grassland,"" the assessment stated. There were a total of 20 wetland species that were found in the area surrounding the railway station, 10 of which were native to the landscape. N. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based conservationist, said, ""The entire Udhagamandalam town, stretching from Charring Cross, extending to Sholur once constituted one of the largest, wetland ecosystem in the entire district."" Successive developmental works have steadily decreased and degraded the wetland ecosystem. ""What little is left needs to be protected,"" he said. If plans to continue the construction were implemented, the Good Shed Road, adjoining the wetland, would be more prone to severe flooding in the future. Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist and founder of ""Upstream Ecology,"" said, ""While it may not be classified as a wetland in revenue records, looking at the topography, ecology and even the types of invasive plants that occur in the area, clearly shows that it is a wetland."""

Licenses have been granted to two additional sites and applications are pending for nine more. Following the recent calamity, residents launched a series of protests against the proliferation of quarries in the area.

With Dasara being a major tourist season when the city comes alive with the celebrations, the Tourism Department initiated the visit and sought the influencers' support for promoting Mysuru tourism on social media. They began their tour visiting Nanjangud temple, Bandipur, and concluded by visiting the sites here. Their posts and content may help attract tourists considering their following on social media pages and the department therefore resolved to bring them to Mysuru with the government having grand plans for the Dasara. Last year, there was a drought. This year, there is plenty of rains and the government hence decided for the grand celebrations. Many influencers drawn from various parts of the States were part of the delegation that experienced and discovered the tourism potential of Mysuru."

The MP's meeting gains significance amidst the decreasing air connectivity since last year, with only two cities now connected to Mysuru, a tourist and a yoga hub. Nanjangud, which is close to the airport, is an industrial town attracting investments. With Mysuru being a tourist hub, tourism is another area that contributes to the traffic. During his meeting, the MP explained the need for good air connectivity in Mysuru, arguing that it will foster trade, business, and generate employment in the constituency. The strong air connectivity will also boost tourism with Mysuru being a preferred tourist destination, attracting a large number of tourists. During the meeting, the MP urged the Minister to ensure flight connectivity to Kochi, Goa, Mumbai, and Hyderabad from Mysuru. ""The Minister has responded positively to the suggestions and assured that needful will be done,"" the MP said. Though the Mysuru airport is undergoing expansion, the decreasing number of flights has put a question mark on the ongoing efforts, with the travellers from Mysuru questioning the purpose behind the airport expansion when the number of flights were getting reduced despite good passenger traffic. Despite several appeals from the trade, tour and travel operators, and hospitality sector for increasing the flights, air connectivity almost remains stagnant. The stakeholders, including tour and travel operators, and regular fliers are demanding more flights from Mysuru. On the demand for long-distance flights by business and trade communities, the government took up the expansion of the airport and the runway expansion required about 206 acres. The previous BJP government allocated Rs319.13 crore for the expansion in 2022 and released two instalments of Rs50 crore and Rs100 crore. The third instalment of Rs75 crore was released by the Congress government led by Mr. Siddaramaiah last year. Stakeholders argue that Mysuru has a good passenger traffic due to expanding trade and business establishments. The Mysuru airport has a runway of 1,750 metres and only ATR-type 72-seater flights can be operated. The proposal is to expand the runway to at least 2,400 metres to enable the operation of long distance flights."

The memorandum to the Chief Minister alleged that juvenile fishing is rampant in the northern districts of Kerala. The juveniles are then sent to fish meal factories in the neighbouring State. The fishes that are used for fishmeal factories are caught despite the rules governing fishing activities and the prescribed minimum legal size of the fishes that can be caught. The fishermen's union also demanded that the government must roll back its decision to steeply increase contributions to welfare fund by fishermen. The fishermen are going through hard days and it is impossible for them to make both ends meet, said convenor of Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi Charles George in the letter. He also said that the government must take the first steps to reconcile the issue of using Turtle Extruder Devices in trawl nets and to get the ban on shrimp from India lifted in the U.S. market. The U.S. has banned buying Indian sea caught shrimp alleging the fishing practices are unsustainable and endangered sea turtles. The fishermen here have claimed that turtles are not harmed on the Western Coast of India because they are not frequently detected in the sea in the area."

The 24-year-old, who was cheated into travelling to Russia and fighting alongside Russian armed forces, returned to Hyderabad in the afternoon on Friday (September 13, 2024) after eight months of war, which seemed an eternity. After an emotional reunion with his family, they drove to their home in Narayanpet in Telangana. ""We were posted at Krynky, and another place, which saw heavy fighting.

""I used to cut logs, dig 14-feet holes and make bunkers. We also loaded ammunition into trucks which then went to soldiers on the frontlines. To threaten us, they fired shots around us.

""When Taliban claimed Afghanistan on August 15, 2021, they said their next target is Jammu and Kashmir. Listen Taliban, you dance or forge enmity or friendship but in your own country. Stop dreaming about Kashmir and creating trouble by piggybacking on Pakistan. If Talibani abba (father) and chacha (uncle) come here, they will be buried in the sea like Osama bin Laden.

According to Health department statistics, 44 confirmed cases have been reported from various parts of the district since the start of September. The cases have been reported from Mararikulam, Kainakary, Chunakara, Nooranad, Panavally, Thuravoor, Punnapra, Devikulangara, Ambalappuzha, Kanjikuzhy, Muhamma, Cherthala, Mannancherry, Pallipuram, Veliayanad, Thanneermukkom, Thycattussery, Kurathikkad, Pathiyoor and Alappuzha municipality. The rise in dengue cases is directly linked to a lack of efforts to reduce mosquito breeding sources. Residents have been asked to initiate vector control measures on their premises and focus on waste management. Officials noted a rise in people turning up at hospitals with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and other viral infections in recent days. Government medical facilities in the district are reporting around 600 fever cases daily. Directive to patients Besides dengue, a few cases of leptospirosis and H1N1 (swine flu) have been reported in the district during the period.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/olympics/uganda-holds-funeral-for-murdered-olympian-rebecca-cheptegei/article68642140.ece,"Ugandans on Saturday (September 14, 2024) paid tributes to Olympian Rebecca Cheptegei, who died after her partner set her on fire in Kenya, ahead of her funeral in her family village. The 33-year-old who debuted this summer in the women's marathon at the Paris Olympics succumbed to severe burns last week after being attacked by Kenyan Dickson Ndiema Marangach. The brutal assault shocked the East African region and prompted a global outpouring of tributes, with activists condemning another act of gender-based violence in Kenya. On Saturday (September 14, 2024) morning, residents, officials and relatives waited in the cold morning light to pay their respects in the village of Bukwo, some 380 km northeast of Uganda's capital Kampala. ""We are extremely saddened,"" said her estranged husband Simon Ayeko, with whom she had two daughters. ""As a father, it has been very difficult,"" he told AFP, explaining he had not been able to break the news to their children. ""Slowly we will tell them the truth."" The service to honour Cheptegei, a sergeant in the Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces, started around 10:00 a.m., with officials and relatives gathering at the local council office. The athlete was a ""heroine"" Bessie Modest Ajilong, the local presidential representative, told AFP. Cheptegei's body would move from local council headquarters, organisers said, to a nearby sports stadium so that the public could pay their respects. She will then be formally laid to rest at around 3:00 p.m. Scores of athletes have travelled to the small village to attend the ceremonies. ""She greatly contributed to the promotion of athletics until her last days,"" coach Alex Malinga, who trained her as a teenager, told AFP. 'Relationship soured' Local media say Cheptegei's daughters witnessed the attack. Police said Marangach snuck into her home while she was at church with her children. Her family say the couple had argued over ownership of the property where she lived with her sister Dorcas Cherop and daughters. Her attacker later died from injuries sustained in the assault. ""I think at that time, their relationship had become sour,"" Cheptegei's brother-in-law, Moses Kipsiro, told AFP. ""I didn't know then something was wrong,"" said Mr. Kipsiro, who previously trained with Cheptegei and also hails from Bukwo. The vicious assault has thrown yet another spotlight on what activists have called a femicide epidemic. Kenya reported 725 femicide cases in 2022 alone, according to the latest U.N. figures. A report the following year by Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics found 34% of women had experienced physical violence since the age of 15. At least two other athletes, Agnes Tirop and Damaris Mutua, have lost their lives in domestic violence incidents since 2021."

Published on September 11, the study assessed safe and just earth-system boundaries (ESBs) to ensure sustainable human and planetary health. ESBs are limits we shouldn't cross in order to maintain the planet's ability to support various ecosystems. Crossing an ESB could harm human populations as well. The study reported that India, China, Europe, and the Americas led the world in accelerated loss of functional integrity over the last 50 years. Functional integrity of ecosystems is an ESB referring to the earth's ability to maintain essential processes in its biospheres. It has already been crossed. According to the study's researchers, India tops the list of countries with the most number of people living with less than 20% functional integrity. Under projected global warming of 2degC in 2100, they found India will also be the third-most vulnerable country to sea-level rise. India also ranked high in the study vis-a-vis the size of the population exposed to extreme temperature if global warming continues unabated. Historically, human population density has been greatest when the mean annual temperature was 11degC-15degC. But with climate change, India will have the most people exposed to mean annual temperatures higher than 29degC if global warming crosses 1.5degC. Large parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula are expected to cross the 29degC mean annual temperature. While most greenhouse gas emissions responsible for this rise in temperature were caused by developed countries, these areas are projected to be the most affected by climate change as a result. In fact, according to the study, the world's richest 10% consume as much energy as the poorest 80%. More than 200 million Indians will be exposed to high wet-bulb temperatures in a world warmer by 2degC world -- the second-largest country-wise population group in the world. The first is in China Many parts of India also grapple with high levels of human-induced phosphorus pollution, especially in surface water runoff. Sewage contributes more than 70% of phosphorus pollution in the Ganga river basin in parts of Bangladesh, China, India, and Nepal whereas agriculture contributes only 17%, according to the study. Phosphorus is an essential micronutrient for plants and therefore crucial for food production, along with nitrogen. However, excess nutrient inputs can harm the health of people and ecosystems. Excess phosphorus can accumulate in soil and sediment particles through absorption or adsorption, preventing it from reaching crops, and creating requirement for more fertilizer. A part of excess phosphorus enters freshwater through runoff or soil erosion and is one of the main reasons of freshwater eutrophication, along with nitrogen. Currently, phosphorus pollution is concentrated in east and south Asia, Europe, and North America, with some hotspots in southeast Asia, southern Africa, and South America. ESB targets related to phosphorus should use reduction in food waste, and improving sewage and wastewater quality as methods to focus on keeping the boundary in check, the research notes. The study also reported that aerosols affect regional climate systems, and in India, they could have contributed to a decline in the amount of summer monsoon rainfall since the 1950s. Previous studies have explored how sulphate aerosols injected into the stratosphere in the northern hemisphere could cause large deficits in Indian monsoon rainfall. Among other pollutants, India also has the highest number of people exposed to PM2.5 above the suggested ESB, according to the study."
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhabi-buch-traded-in-listed-securities-while-in-possession-of-unpublished-price-sensitive-info-congress/article68641884.ece,"Upping the ante over the conflict-of-interest row involving SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Buch, the Congress on Saturday (September 14, 2024) claimed that she traded in listed securities while in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information and has been investing in Chinese firms at a time when India is facing geopolitical tensions with China. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh pointed to ""fresh conflict of interest allegations"" against Mr. Buch, claiming that she, as a whole-time member and later as the SEBI chairperson, traded in listed securities worth Rs36.9 crore. The Congress attack comes a day after Mr. Buch said that she had made all necessary disclosures and complied with recusal guidelines in dealing with companies such as Mahindra Group that hired her husband, as she rejected allegations of impropriety as ""false, malicious and motivated"". Mr. Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch in a joint statement - the second since U.S.-based short seller Hindenburg Research charged her of not being motivated enough to act on allegations against the Adani group due to conflict of interest - also addressed issues raised by the opposition Congress over receiving payments from her previous employer the ICICI Bank while being a whole time member of the SEBI. The statement said Mr. Buch never dealt with any file involving Agora Advisory and Agora Partners - the advisories where she held 99% and continued to earn revenue even after she joined the market regulator body SEBI in 2017. Posing questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Ramesh asked if he is aware that the SEBI chairperson has been trading in listed securities while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. ""Is the PM aware that Madhabi Buch has made high value investments outside India? If yes, what is the date of this investment and date of disclosure?"" Mr. Ramesh asked. ""Is the PM aware that the SEBI chairperson has been investing in Chinese firms at a time when India is facing geopolitical tensions with China,"" the Congress leader asked. Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters here, Congress' media and publicity department head Pawan Khera alleged that between 2017-2023, Mr. Buch, as a whole-time member and later as the SEBI chairperson, traded in listed securities worth Rs36.9 crore. This is in violation of Section 6 of the SEBI's Code on Conflict of Interest for the Members of Board (2008), he said. He also gave a year-wise break-up of the total trading in securities which in total amounted to over Rs36.9 crore. In addition to that, Mr. Khera said, ""We have information that between 2017-2021, Madhabi Buch held foreign assets. We hereby ask: When was the first time she declared the foreign assets and to which agency of the government? Is it true that Ms. Madhabi P. Buch was actively involved in Agora Partners PTE (Singapore) as she was a signatory to the bank account?"" he said. Listing the details of her investment in the U.S. between 2021 and 2024, Mr. Khera claimed that she had invested in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), Global X MSCI China Consumer (CHIQ) and Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ). ""It is deeply concerning to learn that Madhabi Buch, the SEBI chairperson, has been investing in Chinese funds. When the Prime Minister of India can publicly give China a clean chit, it's hardly surprising that a key regulatory figure is engaging in investments linked to China,"" Mr. Khera said. At the press conference, Mr. Khera also recapped previous conflict of interest allegations levelled by the Congress against Mr. Buch. ""From September 2, 2024, the Congress started unravelling the long-kept secrets of the current SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Buch on how she has been deceiving the people of India,"" he said. He pointed to the Congress' earlier allegation that the current SEBI chairperson drew an income of Rs16.8 crores from the ICICI Bank and ICICI Prudential in the form of salary, ESOPS, TDS on ESOPs, while also drawing a salary from the SEBI was brought to the forefront. ""Shockingly, the SEBI was also adjudicating complaints against the ICICI and its affiliates during this period,"" he said. In lieu of a clarification issued by the ICICI Bank, the Congress presented facts with regard to questions raised on ""retiral benefits"", ""ESOPs"", and ""TDS on ESOPs"". So far, ICICI has not responded to our newly- presented facts, Mr. Khera said. ""We disclosed that Ms. Madhabi P. Buch rented her property to 'Carol Info Services Limited', an affiliate of Wockhardt Limited, between 2018-2024. Wockhardt has been under SEBI's investigation for cases, including that of insider trading,"" he said. ""We exposed Ms. Madhabi P. Buch's public lie that Agora Advisory Pvt Ltd became 'immediately dormant' upon her joining SEBI. She still holds a 99% stake in it, and the company has actively provided consultancy/advisory services, receiving Rs2.95 Crores from six SEBI-regulated entities between 2016-2024,"" Mr. Khera added. Through their response, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Pidilite confirm that they made payments to Dhaval Buch via Agora Advisory Private Limited, the Congress leader said. The payments from listed companies, which are regulated by the SEBI to Agora Advisory Private Limited violate Section 5 of Code on Conflict of Interests for Members of Board (2008), he said. ""Further, Mahindra & Mahindra must clarify whether they paid large sums to both Dhaval Buch personally and his joint consultancy, Agora Advisory Private Limited, in which Madhabi Buch holds a 99% stake. If yes, did Mahindra & Mahindra fail to conduct KYC and due diligence before transferring substantial public funds to Agora Advisory Private Limited?"" he said. ""If Dhaval Buch was paid Rs4.78 crores personally, they must also clarify the payment of Rs2.59 crores to Agora Advisory Private Limited, a supposedly 'dormant' company,"" Mr. Khera said. The Congress' allegations come weeks after Hindenburg Research launched a fresh broadside against Mr. Buch, alleging that she and her husband had stakes in obscure offshore funds used in the Adani money siphoning scandal."

That is a key finding of new research published in the Journal of Endometriosis and Uterine Disorders. Our study also found that Black and Hispanic women were less likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis compared with white women. Interestingly, women who identified as part of the LGBTQ community had a higher likelihood of receiving an endometriosis diagnosis than heterosexual women. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the period 2011 to 2019. The survey data use adjusted weights to account for the racial composition of U.S. society, meaning our sample of 17,619 women represents 51,981,323 women of the U.S. population. We specifically examined factors related to quality of life, such as poverty, education and functional impairment, as well as race and sexual orientation. I am a physician-scientist and a researcher in women's health, working together with specialists in OB-GYN from Yale and the University of Texas. Why it matters Endometriosis is a chronic, often painful condition that affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide. It occurs when tissues that would normally line the inner surface of the uterus instead occur outside the uterus, such as on the ovaries or even in distant organs such as the lungs or brain. These abnormally located lesions respond to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, causing pain when stimulated by the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle. Our study sheds light on how endometriosis, despite its prevalence, remains underdiagnosed and under-researched. We found that 6.4% of reproductive-age women in the U.S. had an endometriosis diagnosis. More than 67% reported missed work or school, or having been unable to perform daily activities, due to pain associated with endometriosis. Our study highlights disparities in the diagnosis and management of endometriosis among different racial groups. Black women had 63% lower odds of getting an endometriosis diagnosis, and Hispanic women had 55% lower odds compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disparity may reflect historical biases in health care, pointing to the need for more equitable practices. In addition, our study underscores the importance of considering women's health across diverse population subgroups, with particular attention to sexual orientation. We found that non-heterosexual lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer women had 54% higher odds of receiving an endometriosis diagnosis compared with straight women. Our study was the first to examine endometriosis likelihood among non-heterosexual women at the national level in the U.S. We found no significant association between endometriosis and other quality-of-life indicators such as poverty, education or employment status, which suggests that the condition affects women across various socioeconomic backgrounds. What other research is being done Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis and that their reported pain symptoms are often overlooked. Explanations for this inequity include health care bias against minority women and limited access to medical care among Black women. Research also shows that many medical professionals as well as medical students and residents believe that Black women have a lower pain threshold compared with the white population. This is another possible reason that pain symptoms among Black women with endometriosis get neglected. Researchers from the U.K reported the same findings, attributing these disparities to systemic bias and inequitable medical care. Another study estimates that the lifetime costs associated with having endometriosis are about USD 27,855 per year per patient in the U.S., costing the country about USD 22 billion annually on health care expenditures.

The masterminds were diverting illegally raised funds in the form of virtual assets and bullion. A key accused named Vishnu Rathi has been arrested from Mumbai. The agency registered the case on September 9 against the accused persons, including Mr. Rathi, on the charge that between June and August 2022, they had conspired to target a U.S. citizen by gaining unauthorised remote access to her computer and bank account. On the pretext of offering tech-support services, they falsely informed the victim that her bank account had been compromised. Claiming that the funds were at risk, they allegedly manipulated her into transferring $453,953 to cryptocurrency wallets controlled by them. ""Following the registration of the case (as part of Operation Chakra-III), the CBI swiftly conducted extensive searches at multiple locations linked to the accused, yielding substantial incriminating evidence. Searches carried out at seven locations across Mumbai and Kolkata on September 12 and 13 have revealed that this transnational cyber-enabled financial crimes network was channeling proceeds of crime through virtual assets and bullion,"" an official said. During the search on the residential premises of Mr. Rathi, 57 gold bars of 100 gm each, Rs16 lakh in cash, a mobile phone, and one laptop used to manage cryptocurrencies, details of lockers, and some incriminating documents were allegedly seized."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/confusion-over-listing-of-prevention-of-money-laundering-act-cases-in-madras-high-court/article68641788.ece,"Confusion has arisen in the Madras High Court on the issue of listing petitions related to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002. A Division Bench has directed the Registry to take the issue to the notice of Acting Chief Justice (ACJ) D. Krishnakumar in order to clarify whether the petitions should be listed before Division Benches, comprising two judges, or before single judge benches. The Madras High Court follows the Criminal Rules of Practice, 2019 and the Madras High Court Writ Rules, 2021 with respect to listing of cases. While writ petitions in general get listed before single judges whose orders could be challenged before Division Benches; select writ petitions such as those filed for issuance of habeas corpus get listed directly before Division Benches because they deal with personal liberty. Similarly, most criminal cases too get listed only before single judges but for exceptions such as appeals, filed against imprisonment of over 10 years, which get listed directly before Division Benches. However, orders passed by single judges on the criminal side (including the writ petitions filed in criminal matters) could be challenged only before the Supreme Court and not before Division Benches. On July 23, 2024, a Division Bench of Justices M.S. Ramesh and Sunder Mohan wondered why two criminal original petitions filed against PMLA proceedings had been listed before them and not before a single judge as was the practice followed by almost all High Courts in the country. The Registry explained that it was because of an administrative order passed on January 25, 2017, by the then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (since retired). Ploughing through the records, the judges found that the former CJ had passed the administrative order following a letter written to him by Justice P.N. Prakash (since retired) of the High Court on December 15, 2016. In the letter, the judge had opined that appellate tribunals under the PMLA were headed by retired High Court judges and therefore, it would be appropriate to list PMLA petitions directly before Division Benches. However, the Bench led by Justice Ramesh clarified that the 2017 administrative order of the CJ should be confined only to petitions filed against orders passed by the appellate tribunals and not to every other petition connected with the money laundering law. Since PMLA had both civil as well as criminal consequences, intra court appeal should be permitted for certain petitions filed against PMLA proceedings, the Bench ordered. On September 2, 2024, the same Bench led by Justice Ramesh recalled three crucial paragraphs from its July 23 order and left it to the Chief Justice to take a call on listing of PMLA cases. The decision to recall was taken after the Registry brought it to the judges' notice that Rule 17(1)(vi) of the Madras High Court Writ Rules, 2021 require all writ petitions related to PMLA to be listed before Division Benches and not before single judges. The Division Bench said that the Chief Justice, being the master of the roster, had the prerogative to take a call on listing of cases and also to decide whether the 2021 Writ Rules require an amendment with respect to listing of PMLA related petitions filed before the High Court. It directed the Registry to take the issue to the notice of the incumbent ACJ for passing necessary administrative orders. Another Division Bench On September 12, 2024 when a PMLA related criminal original petition was listed before a Division Bench of Justices S.M. Subramaniam and V. Sivagnanam, the petitioner's counsel I. Abrar Mohamed Abdullah raised an objection and told the judges that a coordinate Bench led by Justice Ramesh had certain doubts over listing of all PMLA petitions before Division Benches and therefore, referred the issue to the ACJ for taking a call. However, the Bench led by Justice Subramaniam wondered why such an objection was being raised now when the 2017 administrative instruction issued on the basis of Chief Justice's decision continued to be in vogue for the last seven years. It pointed out that even Rule 17(3) of the High Court Writ Rules states that writ petitions (criminal) should be posted either before single judges ""or as directed by the Chief Justice."" Therefore, the Chief Justice always holds the prerogative of listing of cases and such a position had been recognised even by the Division Bench led by Justice Ramesh, the Bench led by Justice Subramaniam said. ""In our considered opinion, the administrative order of the honourable Chief Justice dated January 25, 2017, is in force and is bound to be followed by the Registry. Thus, the objection raised by the petitioner is vexatious. Since the matter has been adjourned on several occasions, a final opportunity is granted to argue the matter on merits by September 18,"" the Bench led by Justice Subramaniam concluded."

The top court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Harsh Vibhore Singhal seeking a direction that a time limit be fixed for the Centre to notify the appointment of judges recommended by the apex court collegium. It has also sought a direction to plug the 'zone of twilight' of there being no time for notifying the collegium's recommendations for the appointment of judges to the higher judiciary. The plea said that in the absence of a fixed time period, ""the government arbitrarily delays notifying appointments thereby trampling upon judicial independence, imperilling the constitutional and democratic order and disparaging the majesty and sagacity of the court"". The plea said if any name is not objected to or the appointments are not notified by the end of such fixed time period, then appointments of such judges must be taken as notified."

Addressing an election rally in the Doda district in support of BJP candidates earlier in the day, Mr. Modi said political dynasties in Jammu and Kashmir have destroyed the region and not allowed new leadership to grow. Hitting back at Mr. Modi, the NC leader said the BJP has no qualms in forming alliances with these parties and questioned the prime minister's silence over the death of two army soldiers in an encounter in Kishtawar. ""The PM made a speech in Doda... It has not been 24 hours since the attack (in Kishtwar) in which two brave army soldiers lost their lives while an encounter is going on in north Kashmir ""He talks about dynasties to mislead people. He should have talked about the present situation,"" Mr. Abdullah told reporters in south Kashmir's Kulgam district. The NC leader said when Article 370 was revoked on August 5, 2019, the people of the country were told that the violence in Kashmir was because of the special status and that once it was revoked, the impact of the gun would ""vanish"". ""It has been five years, but encounters are still going on,"" he said. Asked about Mr. Modi's attack on the ""dynastic politics"" of the NC, the Congress, and the PDP, Abdullah said the BJP does not see anything wrong in forming alliances with these parties to come to power. ""When the BJP needed one of these families, that time we were not responsible for the destruction (of J-K). When the BJP had an alliance with the PDP, that time they did not see anything wrong with the PDP. When (former prime minister) (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee had to make a minister and he picked me, there was nothing wrong with us. Now, during the elections, they say that we are wrong,"" Mr. Abdullah said. The NC leader said if the BJP does not have the required numbers to form the government after the polls in Jammu and Kashmir and the PDP decides to support them again, ""Then they (BJP) won't see anything wrong in that"". ""It is a matter of time, such political rhetoric goes on, and then these things are forgotten after the elections are over,"" he added."

""The locality of Zhelannoe Pervoe (Zhelanne Pershe in Ukrainian) was freed thanks to the active and decisive operations of the southern units,"" the defence ministry said. The village is located in the Pokrovsk district, an important logistical hub for the Ukrainian army. Russian forces have advanced rapidly in the eastern region of Donetsk in recent weeks, putting pressure on a Ukrainian army that is short of both soldiers and weapons. The Kremlin regularly claims its army has captured small villages in eastern Ukraine. In a rarer announcement, it said on Tuesday (September 10, 2024) it had captured a town in the region, called Krasnogorivka. On August 6, the Ukrainian army launched an incursion into Russia's border region of Kursk, advancing kilometres into Russian territory and seizing dozens of settlements. It hopes to force Moscow to redeploy troops from Donetsk to Kursk and hamper the Russian advance in Donetsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday (September 13, 2024) Kyiv had ""slowed"" Russia's progress. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that capturing the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, the industrial basin comprising Donetsk and Lugansk was his top priority."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ai-machine-learning-to-be-part-of-6g-says-award-winning-iit-madras-researcher/article68635090.ece,"On a visit to Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh during the recent floods, Radhakrishna Ganti, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, saw first-hand how drones were used to drop food packets to people rendered inaccessible. A son of the soil, he wondered how advanced technology could help the disaster-affected better. On August 22, 2024, the President of India Droupadi Murmu had presented Mr. Ganti with the 'Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar: Yuva Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar' for his work, which primarily focuses on indigenous hardware and wireless communications stack development. He had led the development of 5G radio systems at IIT Madras, and his team is currently designing 6G technologies. Mr. Ganti has made several contributions to global standards bodies and spearheaded the development of rural use cases in the international telecom union to provide modern telecom access and connectivity to remote and rural areas. His work on stochastic geometry for analysis of wireless and cellular networks is globally recognised. 5G in disaster-hit areas Soon, India will roll out 4G using indigenous equipment, Mr. Ganti says. ""In a few months, the entire country will be covered by the 4G network. The equipment is basically designed and made in India. This will also pave the way to upgrade to 5G smoothly,"" he says. This would mean higher speed and faster connectivity for lay mobile phone users, but for the industry, it would mean better control over equipment. Citing the example of using cell phones at traffic signals, Mr. Ganti says, ""Cell phones become slow at traffic signals even with a 4G phone, as more users are accessing the tower. In a disaster-hit area, everyone will try to access the network. In 5G, the concept of network slicing will be introduced. A specific slice of the entire network will be given to the organisation - for example, the police can buy a network slice from the provider. They will be able to get their data and connect, irrespective of what others are doing and be able to provide services at the disaster site,"" he explains. 5G will also be more energy efficient, permitting an organisation to deploy its own network. ""Your data will be secure, and you will have flexibility and other benefits,"" he said. Technologists are also exploring how much more can be done with a 5G network, he adds. Mr. Ganti's team developed new standards based on existing standards for the 5G network. After initial resistance, the international standards body subsequently merged the 5Gi standards with 5G standards. Currently, research is on to introduce self-contained private networks in 6G, he says. ""It is anticipated that the 6G network will be introduced in 2030, and people are looking at technologies that can be included in 6G. Artificial intelligence and machine learning is going to become part of 6G,"" he adds. It is not just about higher speed and better performance but also about drone communications. ""We are in the phase of defining what 6G is going to be and what technologies will go into it, we will know in another couple of years. But already research and standardisation work has started across India. We want to make sure we are well-versed with the technology,"" Mr. Ganti says, adding: ""6G and 5G will provide connectivity to drones. We can see a lot of positive use of drones, like long distance delivery."""

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/watch-what-is-net-zero-a-key-to-tackling-climate-change/article68641890.ece,"India has committed to reach the net zero emission targets by 2070. Think of the atmosphere like a laundry basket. If you keep adding dirty laundry into it without clearing it out, the basket will eventually overflow. Greenhouse gases released into the air work the same way. If we keep adding these gases into our atmosphere without removing them, it will eventually become so dirty that the planet will be in trouble. This is what we're seeing today. Because there's too much carbon dioxide and methane and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we have global warming and climate change. A particular system -- like the atmosphere, but also like a factory or a business or an entire industry or even a whole country -- can become net zero when it's adding and removing an equal level of greenhouse gases from the environment. Net zero is an important goal in the world's fight against climate change because it's a practical way to bring global warming under control. Even if we had to be very, very optimistic about climate change, there's no way we can live on this planet without emitting any greenhouse gases. They're a part of our existence. What we can do is reduce their quantity, and achieve net zero. Of course, net zero is A goal, not THE goal. We need to do many different kinds of things to really get rid of climate change or make it manageable. Net zero is one of them. Maybe the most important goal is to minimise emissions from human activities as much as possible. Nature has its own ways of removing emissions to some extent. For example, mature biomass like old trees and plants can trap and hold some carbon. So one of our goals is to protect these natural mechanisms as well, which we can do by preserving existing forests and their ecosystems instead of destroying or degrading them. All these goals are designed to keep the earth's surface from warming more than 1.5 or 2 degrees celsius from the pre-industrial period. This is what most of the world's countries had decided in 2015 under the Paris Agreement. For more information on this, watch the previous episode of our show. We also look at the impact of Typhoon Yagi in SE Asia, and what the British rock band Massive Attack is doing to protect the environment.

There is lot of the swoon-worthy Gregory Peck-Audrey Hepburn romantic comedy about a princess escaping her guardians and being shown around Rome by an American news reporter in the second part of Emily in Paris, Season 4. And in case you still do not get it, the ninth episode is called 'Roman Holiday.' Emily in Paris Season 4 (Part 2) Episodes: 5 Run time: 30 to 46 minutes Creator: Darren Star Starring: Lily Collins, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Ashley Park, Lucas Bravo, Samuel Arnold, Eugenio Franceschini, Bruno Gouery, Camille Razat, William Abadie, Lucien Laviscoun, Thalia Besson Storyline: A Roman holiday turns into work for Emily as she samples the excellent food and sights Since the 1956 William Wyler classic is a favourite -- Hepburn is so lovely as Princess Anna and Peck so handsome as the far-from-average Joe Bradley, that one is happy to take a whirl around Rome with Emily and her not-so-lonely goatherd on a white scooter sampling the gorgeous burrata, pasta and tiramisu.. Part 2 of Season 4 begins with Emily getting ready to go to Chicago for Christmas. When the flight is cancelled, she joins her chef boyfriend Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) and his ex-lover Camille (Camille Razat) who is pregnant with his child, at her parent's country estate in Megeve... like that would go swimmingly well. Remember Camille's brother, Timothee (Victor Meutelet) and his TikTok video? He explains to Emily that it was nothing personal. Camille, incidentally, is yet to tell Gabriel the truth about her pregnancy. Stranded on the ski slopes, Emily is rescued by a handsome stranger, Marcello, and things are looking interesting again. A bonafide villain is introduced in Genevieve (Thalia Besson). The daughter of Emily's boss, Sylvie's (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) husband, Laurent G, (Arnaud Binard) Genevieve comes from New York looking for a job while crashing on Sylvie's coach in the meantime. When all else fails, Sylvie offers Genevieve a job at her firm, Agence Grateau, after the requisite Paris makeover. Though Emily at first is pleased to show Genevieve the ropes, when she sees her cosying up to Gabriel, she is not so sure. Especially since one of Gabriel complaints to Emily is the fact that she has not made any effort to speak his language, which Genevieve who speaks fluent French deliberately mistranslates. Meanwhile, Emily's best friend Mindy (Ashley Park) has troubles of her own as she accepts a gig to sing revealing more than she would like at the Crazy Horse to fund the band's shot at the Eurovision Contest much to her boyfriend Nicolas's (Paul Forman) discomfort. Nor does Mindy's smoking photo shoot with her ex-boyfriend Benoit (Kevin Dias) help matters, however much Mindy says it is just marketing. Nicolas, who is making a bid for CEO of the luxury goods' family business, feels it reflects badly on him. When everything gets too much for her, Emily takes up Marcello's offer to show her Rome, but work is not far behind as Sylvie tells her Emily to get a meeting with Marcello, which creates some misunderstandings. Emily's co-workers Julien (Samuel Arnold) and Luc (Bruno Gouery) look out for Emily with Julien protecting Emily's chair from the rapacious Genevieve and Luc going into a great deal of trouble with restaurant suggestions for Krakow, when Emily lies about going there instead of Rome. The fashion, with a preponderance of red and polka dots is eye-watering; Emily's ugly Christmas jumper is cute and like mentioned earlier, channeling Audrey Hepburn's timeless gamine style can never go wrong. At the end of Season 4, Emily has an offer that would need the title to be changed. Will she take it up, the nation wants to know. Season four of Emily in Paris is currently streaming on Netflix"

The accused have been identified as Tamilarasan Kuppan (29), Ajith (28), Prakash (26), and Aravindan (23). They were arrested from Pallipattu in Tamil Nadu. ""All the four accused were involved in incorporation of shell companies and opening of bank accounts, through which Proceeds of Crime (PoC) generated from cyber scams were laundered,"" said the Agency. While the ED has secured their four-day custody from a special court in Bengaluru for interrogation, it has frozen PoC of Rs2.80 crore in the bank account of a shell company. The ED initiated the investigation on the basis of First Information Reports (FIRs) registered at various police stations across the country, including the one lodged with the Special Offences and Cyber Crime Police, Jaipur. ""The whole process and activities related to transactions in the bank accounts of these shell companies were done through a WhatsApp group where Tamilarasan, Ajith, Aravindan, Prakash along with Chinese scammers were members,"" it said.

He stated that the announcement was made on the same day on which the High Court had given a ruling instructing the Legislative Assembly Speaker's office to fix the timeline for hearing the disqualification petitions filed by the BRS against Danam Nagender, Kadiyam Srihari and Tellam Venkata Rao, who were elected on BRS tickets and defected to the Congress, within four weeks. Recollecting how, as the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, A. Revanth Reddy spoke asking people to stone to death the defected MLAs in the past and how he himself was visiting the BRS MLAs houses and admitting them to the Congress party, Mr. Rama Rao stated that several Ministers and MLAs of the Congress were repeatedly speaking that only 10 BRS MLAs had joined them and more would follow soon. Stating that the High Court ruling on the defected MLAs had filled fear among the them as also in the ruling Congress party, the BRS leader said they had first filed disqualification petitions before the Speaker by citing the Supreme Court judgment given in the matter of Congress MLAs joining BJP in Manipur in the past and then only moved the High Court. It was Padi Kaushik Reddy, the BRS MLA from Huzurabad, who had filed the petition. Keeping it in mind, the ruling party had instigated attack on Mr. Reddy's residence on Thursday (September 12, 2024) with the help of a mob comprising the Congress 'goondas' and followers of the Serilingampally MLA who himself led the attack from the front with the ""full cooperation"" of the police as they remained mute spectators during the attack.

""It was the responsibility of all the 10 defected MLAs to justify their joining the ruling party publicly and explain people in which party they were in now,"" Mr. Rama Rao said adding that a factional-feud-like episode had taken place for the first time in Telangana politics and Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy was wholly responsible for it. Mr. Rama Rao alleged that unable to keep the umpteen promises made as part of the six guarantees, Mr. Revanth Reddy was enacting a drama in the name of HYDRAA to divert people's attention from the unfulfilled promises. He remarked that the nine-and-a-half months rule of Mr. Reddy was going on like ""asmarthuni jeevana yatra"" (journey of an incapable person)."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/realme-13-review-shines-in-performance-and-power/article68641792.ece,"Expanding its 13 series, Chinese smartphone maker Realme launched the Realme 13+. Unlike the 13 Pro, which runs on the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, the new Realme 13+ is powered by the Dimensity 7300 chipset. However, it is priced lower than the 13 Pro, aligning closer to the 20K segment. For buyers, the introduction of the Realme 13+ provides an additional option in the 13 series lineup. Let's dive deeper into the Realme 13+. Design There seems to be a slight downgrade from the 12 series, which featured a faux leather rear. The Realme 13+ sports a glossy marble design on the back. Despite its shiny rear, the phone resists smudges. However, I would have preferred the design to cover the entire body, as it stops just short of the circular camera module. The phone boasts an IP65 rating. Realme has retained the familiar setup of buttons and ports, with the volume rocker and power button on the right side. At the bottom, you'll find the hybrid SIM tray (capable of holding either two SIM cards or one SIM card and an SD card), a USB-C port, and a speaker grille. The inclusion of a 3.5mm audio jack is a welcome feature. The fingerprint sensor is integrated into the display and responds swiftly. Display The Realme 13+ features a 6.67-inch OLED display, delivering sharp visuals with a 1080 x 2400 FHD+ resolution. It supports a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, ensuring smooth scrolling and an immersive viewing experience. The display also offers a 180 Hz touch sampling rate, with an instantaneous peak of 1200 Hz, making it highly responsive to touch inputs. The brightness is impressive, with a typical level of 600 nits and a peak of 2000 nits, ensuring clear visibility in bright outdoor conditions. The display also supports Rainwater Smart Touch, allowing it to function well in wet conditions. (For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today's Cache) When compared to the Realme 13 Pro, both devices share several key features, including the 120 Hz refresh rate and the peak brightness of 2000 nits, providing smooth visuals and strong outdoor performance. However, the 13 Pro has a slight edge overall. OS The Realme 13+ runs on Realme UI 5.0, built on Android 14. Unfortunately, the OS comes loaded with pre-installed apps, giving it a somewhat cluttered feel. The phone includes AI Boost 2.0, which intelligently optimises app performance based on usage habits, enhancing efficiency. Additional AI features, like AI Smart Loop and AI Clear Voice, further improve the experience. AI Smart Loop is especially useful for enhancing multitasking and overall usability. Processor The Realme 13+ excels in handling demanding tasks and resource-heavy games, thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chipset. The processor delivers strong performance, outpacing most rivals in its class, though it slightly trails behind the budget-friendly iQOO Z9 in benchmarks. With up to 12 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256 GB of UFS 3.1 storage, multitasking is seamless, and storage speeds are impressive. The phone also includes a stainless-steel vapour chamber cooling system, ensuring it remains cool during prolonged gaming or intensive use. In benchmarks, the Realme 13+ delivers solid results, scoring 1052 points in GeekBench's Single-Core test and an impressive 2938 in the Multi-Core test. Its GPU performance is equally commendable, with a score of 2596. These figures surpass those of the Realme 13 Pro and outperform competitors like the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion and the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite. In everyday use, the phone feels smooth, with fluid animations and no stutter. It easily handles daily tasks and pushes up to 90 FPS in games like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile. The inclusion of GT Mode further enhances gaming performance, offering features like Geek Power Tuning for clock speed management, Game Focus Mode, and Voice Changer for a more immersive gaming experience. Camera The Realme 13+ impresses with its camera setup, featuring a 50 MP Sony LYT-600 primary sensor paired with a 2 MP secondary lens. In daylight, the primary camera produces vibrant photos with a balanced dynamic range and accurate colours. Outdoor shots show sharp detail, although occasional HDR blooming occurs, but it doesn't detract significantly from the overall quality. Close-up shots exhibit a pleasing natural effect, and portrait shots offer lifelike skin tones, although edge detection could be slightly more precise. The 2x in-sensor zoom delivers respectable results, retaining good detail and dynamic range with minimal compromise. Night mode is competitive for its class, handling low-light scenes well with minimal noise, though finer details could be improved. The 16 MP front-facing selfie camera, housed in a hole-punch cutout, delivers solid results. Selfies are sharp with good colour reproduction, and even in portrait mode, it handles background separation reasonably well, making it a reliable option for social media. Battery The Realme 13+ is equipped with a 5000 mAh battery that easily lasts through a full day, whether gaming, streaming, or multitasking. It supports 80 W Ultra Charge, significantly reducing charging time. The included charger takes the phone from 0 to 100% in 42-46 minutes, making it highly convenient for users on the go. Verdict The Realme 13+ shines in terms of performance and power, outperforming competitors like the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, the Nord CE 4 Lite, and even the Realme 13 Pro. Overall, the Realme 13+ stands out as a strong contender in the mid-range market, offering a well-rounded experience with only minor areas for improvement, such as reducing the bloatware. Starting at Rs22,999, Realme buyers may find it challenging to choose between models, as they are very close in terms of design and performance, potentially leading to internal competition within the series."

Officials have pegged the estimated cost of the repairs to Yeleru reservoir around Rs1,000 crore and steps were being taken for the preparation of a Detailed Project Report (DPR). Andhra Pradesh floods: Central team gets down to task; govt. pegs preliminary damage at Rs6,880 crore Addressing media persons at the Jana Sena Party (JSP) office near Mangalagiri in Guntur district on Saturday (September 14, 2024), Mr. Manohar said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and JSP president and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan have devoted their time and energy to mitigate the impact of the floods that wreaked havoc in Vijayawada city and succeeded in it to a large extent. He said both the Government and people were alert following the heavy rain warning but it was well beyond all expectations. The situation was aggravated by the sheer negligence of the condition of Budameru during the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). But, YSRCP president and former CM Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy made some irresponsible comments regarding the condition of Budameru and also Yeleru and the flood relief operations, he stated. Referring to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy's statement that the flood in Vijayawada city was a man-made disaster, Mr. Manohar said it was due to the record-breaking rains and what fits that description was the Annamayya dam break that took place in 2021, when YSRCP was in power. Will launch 'Operation Budameru' to prevent flooding of Vijayawada in future, says A.P. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu The YSRCP Government had not done proper review of the Water Resources Department and never made the required fund allocations for projects.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/uthrada-pachil-takes-kerala-by-storm/article68641744.ece,"Onam shoppers strived to run down the clock on Saturday (September 14, 2024), the eve of Kerala's Thiru Onam festival. They thronged markets, flower shops and sweet meat stalls to prepare a sumptuous spread for friends and family on Sunday. The holiday cheer seemed evident in the long queues before confectionaries sold payasam, bolis, and banana chips, obligatory delicacies for the traditional Onam feast. The State government had called off official celebrations, given the catastrophic landslide which claimed 264 lives and razed three villages in Wayanad in July. Nevertheless, the low spirit evoked by the natural disaster appeared, arguably, on the wane as families crowded malls, electronic gadget stores, and textile showrooms, casting about for closing-hour bargain buys. Uthrada Pachil Saturday, which marks the much-celebrated Uthrada Pachil"", a spurt of pre-Thiru Onam retail activity, is perhaps most evident in the iconic Chalai market in Thiruvananthapuram. The confined shop-lined streets are abuzz with street vendors hawking products ranging from clothes, toys, trinkets, glass bangles, and imitation gold ornaments. Upscale malls, car and motorbike showrooms, and retail chains turned their expansive premises into Onam wonderlands, complete with artists decked out as Mahabalis, the mythical king and festival mascot, and traditional art form performances, including Kathakali, Theyyam, and Chanda Melam. Agrarian past Onam also marks a transient revival of long-lost agrarian traditions. Several resident associations and youth clubs set up swings and organised traditional feats of strength, such as tugs-of-war, pole climbing, and log pillow fights. The season also sees the temporary revival of traditional games, including ""Kuttiyum Kolum and Uri Adi"". Homecoming season Onam is also a season of homecoming for the vast diaspora of Keralites worldwide. Thousands have returned home to reunite with their families and savour the wistfulness for a pastoral past almost erased by rapid urbanisation. Secular heritage Onam also marks the apogee of the auspicious first month of the Malayalam Calendar, Chingam. The festival is a major cultural and social event in the State's calendar and has long been emblematic of Kerala's secular and inclusive heritage. In considerable measure, Onam transcends religious, economic, and regional differences. Onam myth The festival celebrates the return from exile of the mythical Mahabali, an asura king banished by gods to the netherworld out of envy for his populist and even-handed rule. The lore has it that Kerala bedecks itself during Onam to hail the return of its tragic fairy tale king. Floral welcome The ubiquitous floral patterns adorning the patios of homes during Onam signal ""Mahabali's arrival."" They are also a mark of his welcome. Onam also refers to the legend of an imaginary egalitarian, prosperous, and utopian Kerala under Mahabali's fairy tale reign. The myth also holds a particular poignancy for Keralites. According to legend, Mahabali is fated to return to the netherworld after a joyful day with his subjects, stirring a vaguely wistful longing for next year's Onam and manifesting as a moving reminder of the inexorable passage of seasons."

In Delhi, retail onion price fell from Rs60 to Rs55 per kg, while Mumbai saw a decrease from Rs61 to Rs56 per kg. In Chennai, the retail price reduced from Rs65 to Rs58 per kg, the ministry said in a statement. The government initiated the sale of onions at a subsidised rate of Rs35 per kg through mobile vans and outlets of NCCF and NAFED. The program, which began in Delhi and Mumbai, has since expanded to other major cities including Chennai, Kolkata, Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, and Guwahati. Responding to the growing demand, the government has decided to increase the quantity of subsidised onion and expand distribution channels to include e-commerce platforms, Kendriya Bhandar outlets, and Mother Dairy's SAFAL stores. The government has also initiated wholesale disposal of onion in major cities. It has already commenced in Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai, with plans to extend to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata and eventually all state capitals. A dual transportation strategy involving both road and rail networks is being implemented to improve logistics efficiency and reduce post-harvest losses. The Department of Consumer Affairs is working closely with state governments to ensure targeted supply based on demand and price trends. With a buffer stock of 4.7 lakh tonne of onions and increased kharif sowing area compared to the previous year, ""the government expects onion prices to remain under control in the coming months,"" the ministry said. The combination of enhanced retail and bulk sale strategies is anticipated to stabilize prices and ensure widespread availability of affordable onions, it added."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/education/how-the-concept-of-open-science-can-be-beneficial/article68620802.ece,"Open science includes a set of principles and practices, such as free access to publications, free availability of data sets, use of open-source software, and involvement of society in research through citizen science. The main idea is to make scientific research and findings from all fields available to everyone without any restrictions. Open science encourages transparency and collaboration in research through sharing of information and making it accessible to everyone and strives to solve the limitations of traditional methods of research outreach, including restricted access to publications, research data and tools. Ethical considerations When it comes to open-access publishing, every party -- including author, publishers, editor and reviewer -- plays a crucial role in maintaining transparency and integrity. The author is mainly responsible for providing real data without fabrication, avoiding plagiarism, and giving due acknowledgement to the work of others. He/she should always give due credit to all contributors but avoid ghost-authoring. Declaration of conflict of interest -- whether financial, professional or personal -- is essential to prevent interference with the research outputs. On the other hand, the publisher should adhere to a strict peer review processes to ascertain the reliability and reproducibility of the research work. Unfortunately, there are a few open-access publishers that do not offer rigorous and unbiased peer reviews, thus lowering the quality of publications. As more journals adopt open-access publications, all parties should adhere to ethical publication principles to maintain the standards. Impact of AI Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing different technical and non-technical fields with advances in automation. It will have an impact on open science by aiding in rapid data mining and data analysis. As most of the current AI tools depend on the vast databases created from the data pooled from different sources, it can further encourage data sharing through collaborations. By doing this, open science benefits AI by providing much-needed data through participative research and inclusive practices. On the other hand, AI poses challenges for open science due to its closed nature, which can affect reliability, reproducibility, and bias. Open science principles, especially transparency in data, need to be applied to AI to address these issues. Benefits The most important aspect of open science is unrestricted access to the knowledge created, including research articles, data sets, educational resources, and so on. It enables students and researchers to enhance their knowledge and research capacity. Further, for researchers, visibility of their work is important and is provided through publishing in open-access journals. Students and researchers get the opportunity to work on collaborative research projects involving researchers from different institutes and countries. The future of open science is exciting, and set to play a crucial role in shaping research and education in the future. It enables better research outputs, transparency in research, inclusivity and better utilisation of research funds. Open science makes research outputs easily findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR principle). Implementing open science poses a few technological, political, organisational, economic, and legal challenges. The research community can solve these issues by having will, collaborating, and finding funding opportunities.

They arrived for the discussion around 6.45 p.m. West Bengal Chief Secretary Manoj Pant had extended the invitation after the West Bengal Junior Doctors' Front wrote to him welcoming Ms. Banerjee's visit but insisted on an audience with her to discuss their demands. In a fresh attempt to placate protesting resident doctors, Ms. Banerjee visited the protest site of resident doctors in the Salt Lake area and urged doctors to return to work. ""I came to meet you as your 'Didi' (elder sister), not as the Chief Minister...This is my last attempt to resolve the crisis,"" Ms. Banerjee told the protesting doctors. The Chief Minister also assured the protesting doctors like her brothers and sisters that she will not take action against them. 'I support your movement... I am going to study the demands placed before us, and if anyone is guilty, we will take appropriate action. I want justice to be served. I will appeal to the CBI to give justice as early as possible,"" she said.

The Chief Minister announced that she is dissolving all the ""Rogi Kalyan Commitee (Patient Welfare Body)' of all state-run hospitals, including R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. The resident doctors have been on strike since August 9, when the body of a 31-year-old doctor was found at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. Protesting doctors welcomed the visit of the Chief Minister but said that they will withdraw from the strike till their demands are met. The doctors urged for immediate talks with the State Government to resolve the imbroglio. The agitating junior doctors said they would not compromise on their demands while continuing their sit-in demonstration outside the State Health Department headquarters for the fifth consecutive day on Saturday (September 14, 2024). The five-point demand of doctors includes the removal of the Kolkata Police Commissioner and senior officials of the State Health Department. The other demands of the doctors include increased security for health workers and an end to the ""threat culture"" in hospitals and medical colleges across West Bengal. Talks between the State Government and the doctors could not start on September 12, 2024. With the protesting doctors demanding livestream of the meeting with the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, the State government did not allow and insisted it was a 'subjudice matter' and could not be streamed or telecast live on Thursday (September 12, 2024). The junior doctors protesting in West Bengal wrote to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday (September 13, 2024), requesting their intervention in the impasse with the R.G. Kar hospital rape and murder case. The Chief Minister had earlier said, ""29 precious lives have been lost due to disruption in health services because of long-drawn cease work by junior doctors"". She even announced financial relief of Rs2 lakh to families whose kin have died due to ""disruption"" of health services. The protesting doctors had laid siege to the Swastha Bhawan on Tuesday (September 10, 2024) a day after the Supreme Court urged the doctors to resume duty. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said on September 9 (Monday) that doctors cannot remain oblivious to the needs of the community they are intended to serve and appealed them to return to work by 5 p.m. on September 10, 2024."

They only promoted their own kith and kin,"" the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also targeted the manifestoes of the NC, Congress and PDP in his speech. ""Voters have to choose between BJP's 'Sankalp Patra' and these parties' manifestos, advocating return of the old bad days.

A Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) team comprising investigation and technical officers visited the Adiala Jail to question Mr. Khan, the founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, in connection with a controversial post on his official X account. ""A case has been registered against Mr. Khan by the FIA for inciting government officials to mutiny,"" the Dawn newspaper said citing sources. The FIA personnel returned empty-handed after Mr. Khan, 71, insisted that he would not join the interrogation without the presence of his lawyers. Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar in a statement earlier said the FIA would probe into the handling of the PTI founder's social media accounts, which were being used allegedly to ""create chaos and anarchy"" in the country, and ""undermining the national security"". Mr. Tarar said it would be ascertained who was the handler of his social media accounts, and whether such posts were being made at his behest or it was done on directives of someone else. He said a botched attempt had been made to conspire against the sitting chief justice and heads of other institutions. Through these posts, he tried to mobilise the people against two major State institutions. ""His acts were highly condemnable,"" Mr. Tarar said. Mr. Khan, who has been incarcerated at the Adiala Jail since last year, has often criticised the powerful establishment through his longish posts on X. On Friday, Mr. Khan posted a long note on his X account, which said, ""This is not the first time in the history of this country that one individual (referring to Army Chief Gen Asim Munir) has put the entire country at stake to protect his hold on power. (General) Yahya Khan also betrayed the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to stay in power."" He recalled the events from 1971 when 90,000 soldiers were taken as prisoners during Bangladesh's Liberation War and how former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto himself admitted to the loss of 50,000 innocent lives. ""Even today, the same story is being repeated. Once again, one person has taken over control and is destroying the system to prolong and strengthen his hold on power,"" he said, adding that a small powerful elite dominates all the resources, power, and control of the country. The Supreme Court is the only institution somewhat safe from their influence, and now it is also being attacked, he said."

He also said that farmers will hugely benefit from the Centre's decision to increase the customs duty on crude and refined sunflower and soybean oils. Talking to reporters at the Nagpur airport while answering a query on Mr. Khadse's possible return to the Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr. Fadnavis said, ""Whatever decision the BJP's central leadership takes will be accepted. We will hold talks with the party leadership, and a decision will be made after the ongoing Ganesh festival."" Speculation about Mr. Khadse, a former BJP leader currently with the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, returning to the saffron party intensified after the BJP renominated his daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse as Lok Sabha candidate and made her a Union Minister of State after she won. But there has been no announcement from the BJP yet on his reinduction, despite Mr. Khadse expressing willingness earlier this year. Speaking to a regional news channel earlier this week, Mr. Khadse said, ""I was not keen on returning to the BJP fold, but senior leaders of the party insisted on it. When I met BJP president J. P. Nadda, he felicitated me with a scarf and declared that I had become part of the BJP."" Mr. Khadse joined the undivided Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in October 2020 after quitting the BJP. He had then accused Mr. Fadnavis of trying to destroy his political career. Talking to reporters, Mr. Fadnavis welcomed the hike in basic customs duty on the crude and refined sunflower and soybean oils. The Government increased the basic customs duty on crude palm, soybean, and sunflower seed oil from nil to 20% and the basic customs duty on refined palm, soybean, and sunflower oil from 12.5% to 32.5% on Friday (September 13, 2024). It also cut the duty on onion export to 20% from 40%, which was in place since May 4. ""The Modi government has taken very important decisions so that farmers get good price for their produce. Farmers will hugely benefit from these moves,"" he said. ""Earlier, a crisis had emerged on the issue of onions. But the government's decision to slash export duty on onion will prove to be hugely beneficial to the growers of this crop. All these decisions will benefit soybean, onion and Basmati rice farmers and it will indirectly benefit cotton growers as well,"" he said. Hailing the renaming of Port Blair as Sri Vijaya Puram, Mr. Fadnavis said the symbols of slavery should be removed.

""The State government stands with all its officers and employees, and the Congress should apologise,"" he said. Mr. Yadav said the Congress has been out of power in the state for more than 20 years and even failed to run the government when they came to power for some time (the 15-month Congress rule in 2019-20).

The film, directed by Scott Goldberg, also features Edward Furlong (Terminator 2) and Dee Wallace (The Howling). Duvall, known for her iconic performances in The Shining and the films of Robert Altman, passed away earlier this year at 75. Goldberg was thrilled to work with Duvall, whom he reached out to in 2023 for a supporting role in the indie horror film. Despite being filmed remotely from her Texas home and directed via Zoom, Duvall brought her talent to the project. She expressed joy at returning to acting, saying, ""Acting again--it's so much fun. It enriches your life."" This role was especially meaningful as she had expressed a desire to act again before her passing. The Forest Hills follows Rico (Chiko Mendez), a man haunted by nightmarish visions after suffering head trauma in the Catskills. Edward Furlong plays Billy, a character who convinces Rico that he can transform into a werewolf, with Furlong himself undergoing a transformation in the film. The movie also stars Jamie Marsh, Chiko Mendez, Felissa Rose, Linda Flores, Marianne Hagan, and Stacey Nelkin and is produced by Dreznick-Goldberg Productions, Digital Thunderdome, and Scott Hansen."

""It's a very important duty that we have as citizens and (I am) looking forward to being able to vote from space, which is pretty cool,"" Ms. Williams, who is of Indian origin, said on a call with reporters on Friday (September 12, 2024) afternoon. Ms. Williams, 58, and Wilmore, 61, participated in a press conference on Friday (September 12, 2024) from the International Space Station (ISS), which has been their home since June. Their Boeing Starliner spacecraft ran into several problems mid-flight and could not bring them home from a planned 8-day voyage. ""I sent down my request for a ballot today,"" Mr. Wilmore said. ""It's a very important role that we play as citizens including those elections, and NASA makes it very easy for us to do that,"" he said. They, however, did not indicate which presidential candidate - either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris - would get their vote. American astronauts have been voting from space since 1997 when the Texas legislature passed a bill allowing NASA employees to vote from space, New York Post reported. That year, NASA astronaut David Wolf became the first American to vote from space on the Mir Space Station. In 2020, NASA astronaut Kate Rubins also performed her civic duty from space on the ISS. Election officials in Harris County, Texas - where NASA's Johnson Space Station is located - told NBC News that they work with NASA to send astronauts a PDF with clickable boxes to make their choices. The PDF is password-protected to ensure a secret ballot. Friday's (September 12, 2024) press conference came exactly one week after the Starliner returned to Earth - without its crew - to make room on the space station for SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is now due to bring the two astronauts' home in February. Ms. Williams and Wilmore are living on the ISS with seven other astronauts. They said they feel ""grateful"" to spend more time in space, despite difficulties. When asked if it was difficult to see the Starliner leave without them, Ms. Williams said they were tasked with ensuring it left the ISS safely. ""We were watching our spaceship fly away,"" she said. Ms. Williams said as she and Mr. Wilmore used to work in the Navy, they are ""not surprised when deployments get changed. It's risky and that's how it goes in the business,"" she said. When asked if they feel let down by NASA and Boeing, Mr. Wilmore said, ""Absolutely not."" Pointing to Ms. William's t-shirt with a NASA logo, he said: ""That represents something that we stand for as an agency - we go beyond, we do things that are out of the ordinary. This is not easy,"" he added. He said that 90% of their astronaut training is about preparing for ""the unexpected"". Ms. Williams, who has just been named the commander of the International Space Station, said she was in good spirits. ""We're here with our friends, we've got a ride home,"" she said, adding that she is looking forward to the next couple of months on board the ISS."

Kar Hospital, the public response to the incident is being seen as the biggest mass movement Kolkata has witnessed post-Independence, with only a couple of outcries that still remain in people's memory, one of them being when the tram fare was raised by one paisa. Also read: Kolkata doctor rape and murder case: A timeline of events But while the other memorable displays of public anger -- tram burning in 1953 over hike in fare, food movement in 1959, and more recently protests against the Nandigram firing, in 2007 -- had political parties involved some way or the other, the movement for justice in the R.G. Kar Hospital case belongs to the common people of Kolkata: the masses. ""This is undoubtedly the first mass agitation in Bengal after independence. The movement grew organically and it is possible that even some Trinamool Congress women are participating in it. It is independent of political ideologies and has evolved into a call for conscience, something that is lacking today. Because of this, it is receiving support from people across the world,"" said acclaimed documentary-maker Mahadeb Shi, himself a regular participant in protests, the ones for saving the iconic Kolkata tram. ""In fact, the current movement may be compared to the 1953 tram fare protest, which was pivotal in Kolkata's history, reflecting the city's political and social tensions in the post-independence era. There are many common factors that sparked the initiation of both movements. In both instances, students played a key role, which added to the energy and idealism; also, at the moment, Kolkata is facing the same economic decline and rising unemployment as it saw in 1950s,"" Mr. Shi told The Hindu. So widespread has been the public outcry in the rape-murder case that even Salt Lake City, a self-contained township that usually remains insulated from the noise of protests, became an integral part of it right from the beginning. In fact, the neighbourhood is presently serving as the epicentre of the movement because the Health Department, where young doctors are staging a sit-in in spite of the rains, is located there. Also read: Kolkata doctor rape and murder case: The complete coverage ""Bengal, particularly Kolkata, has never seen such mass protests that were non-political in the beginning. After all, it is the heinous killing of a young woman, who was a doctor and a meritorious student. Salt Lake City could not have been left out. Also, a demographic change in the neighbourhood over the years, from urban elites to homogenisation with the masses, has made it a part of the protest,"" said technocrat-entrepreneur Indranil Aich, a long-time resident. Ishita Mukhopadhyay, a professor of economics at the University of Calcutta, said the movement had acquired the international language of protest, like what happened in the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter, when people of all professions were involved and new solidarity groups were formed. ""From the decade of 2010, many countries of the world have seen mass uprisings like the Occupy movement, Arab Spring, etc. The language in which the protest speaks is through slogans, music, plays, with the central slogan visible in every place. In this case, it is Justice. Pasted on your shirt, shop doors, stations, everywhere. This is the international pattern of involving masses,"" Prof. Mukhopadhyay said. Everybody in Kolkata is talking about 'R.G. Kar'. In buses, in suburban trains. Taxi drivers, who normally keep to themselves, are joining in conversations of passengers. Gouri Ganguly, a school teacher, recently went to a popular saree shop at Lake Market to buy Durga Puja gifts for her domestic helps. The shop was empty, even at seven in the evening. Once the purchases were made, the shop owner asked Ms. Ganguly if she would like to see sarees for herself. When she refused, the owner said, ""Yes, I cannot even persuade you.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/education/medical-curriculum-revision-sparks-outrage-by-activists-over-omission-of-disability-transgender-rights/article68641568.ece,"Disability rights activists and transgender advocates have raised alarms over the non-inclusion of provisions outlined in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPDA), 2016 and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act (TPA), 2019 in the National Medical Commission's revised Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) Curriculum. In a letter addressed to Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Dr. Virendra Kumar, the leaders of disability and transgender communities expressed their dismay. The letter penned by Central Advisory Board on Disability Chairperson Dr. Satendra Singh and Association for Transgender Health in India CEO Air Commodore (Retd.) Dr. Sanjay Sharma highlighted how the new curriculum, released on August 31, 2024, fails to address critical issues impacting these marginalized groups. ""The curriculum has been deemed outdated and archaic, contradicting the Supreme Court judgements and previous guidelines,"" stated the letter. The controversy led to widespread media coverage and public backlash, culminating in the withdrawal of the curriculum on Teachers' Day, September 5, 2024. While the revised curriculum was re-released on Thursday (September 12, 2024), the activists are disheartened by its failure to reintegrate disability competencies and adequately address transgender health issues. ""Despite an acknowledgment of the oversight by a senior NMC member, the curriculum remains unchanged on these fronts,"" the letter said. One of the most striking omissions is the failure to include key terms such as ""dignity"" and ""transgender"" within the 466-page document. The curriculum dedicates eight hours to sports during the foundation course but has completely removed the previously mandated seven hours of disability competencies. Also Read: Editorial on the Competency-Based Medical Education Curriculum guidelines Moreover, terms like ""gender identity disorders"" continue to appear in psychiatry, while physiology continues to describe intersex variations as ""abnormalities"". This lack of inclusion has broader implications. The letter pointed out that the RPDA mandates integrating disability rights into educational curriculums for University teachers, doctors, nurses, and paramedical personnel. The omission of these competencies, which were previously part of the 2019 curriculum, is not only a setback for disability rights but also undermines India's commitment to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 10), which aim to reduce inequality. The letter also underscored the importance of transgender-inclusive healthcare as mandated by the TPA, 2019. Section 15 of the Act requires medical curricula to address transgender-specific health issues, including creating a health manual for sex reassignment surgeries. Yet, the new curriculum remains focused on a binary understanding of gender, ignoring the health needs of transgender individuals entirely. The activists urged Dr. Kumar to intervene and ensure the reintroduction of mandatory disability competencies before the start of the new MBBS session on October 14. They further requested that case studies focusing on disability, transgender, and queer persons be included in the longitudinal ethics curriculum, ensuring that the voices of marginalized communities are not ignored in the country's medical education framework."

If the taxation proposal moves through, this will be the third hike of beer prices in Karnataka in just over a year after the Additional Excise Duty was first increased from 175% to 185% in July 2023, and again increased from 185% to 195% in February 2024. The first increase of AED led to cost of beer increasing by Rs10 to Rs15 per 650 ml bottle, the second rise led to Rs15 increase in bottle, industry data claimed. Classification Proposing classification of beer with 6.5% to 8% alcohol content from the current category of two to three, the excise duty calculated for it has been proposed to be increased by Rs20 per bulk litre. Also, a duty of Rs16 per bulk litre has been proposed on beers having alcohol content between 5% and 6.5%. On beers with less than 5% alcohol, the duty of Rs 10 per bulk litre will remain the same. The FSSAI classifies ""beer"" as those below 5% and those between 5% to 8% in alcohol content. Brewers claim that the cheapest beer that costs around Rs90 to Rs95 a bottle now will be about Rs140 a bottle if new rate kicks in, and Karnataka - known for beer culture where 11 active breweries function - would be among the costliest states for beer in the country. Incidentally, Karnataka is the third largest beer market in the country. Finance Department sources confirmed the move and said the reclassification was meant for taxation purpose. Acknowledging that the cost of beer will increase, sources defended the new classification stating that the proposed duty hike is not too high. ""We are worried that if the excise duty is increased on beer with 6.5% to 8% alcohol content, nearly 90% of the beer sold in Karnataka will become expensive by around Rs15 per bottle as Rs20 per bulk litre is being proposed. This would be the third tax increase in one year on beer, which is something unheard of anywhere. We are also unclear about the reasoning behind this new classification,"" said Vinod Giri, the Director General of Brewers Association of India. He said that this proposed tax increase on beer contrasts with IMFL where the Government has taken steps to reduce duty on premium products and hold on lower end IMFL, and there are fears of people moving from beer to IMFL. Memorandum to govt. In its memorandum to the Government, the Brewers Association has expressed fear that the beer volumes could fall from the current 480 to 490 lakh cases annually in the State to about 370 to 380 lakh cases annually, bringing down the estimated beer revenue from Rs5,850 crore- Rs5,950 crore to Rs5,450 crore - Rs5,550 crore due to increased excise duty. Citing statistics of growth of beer that contributed to about 16% of total excise revenues in 2023-2024, up from 10% in 2021-2022, Mr. Giri said, ""There is no need to derail the growth rate. Also, the industry sees this as being unfair as the State has rationalised IMFL rates, bringing down the cost of IMFL while increasing the price of beer."" Subject to alcohol content However, Finance Department sources argued that there was nothing wrong in taxing beer with higher alcohol content with higher excise duty. ""The duty on beer with less than 5% alcohol content will remain the same. Our study has revealed that certain low cost beer has higher alcohol content though strictly beer is seen as a low alcoholic content in the West where alcohol content is typically 2% to 3%. More alcohol in the beer will attract higher duty."" The high alcohol content beer is also affecting the sale of lower end IMFL to a certain extent, sources added."

Morkel, who has worked with current head coach Gautam Gambhir in Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), has been in India enough times and seen it from close quarters to understand how it works and where he would fit into the ecosystem. ""Coming here, this is a set-up that operates by itself and so to protect that and make it better in small ways is going to be the goal,"" Morkel told BCCI.TV, making it clear that his focus is on minor tweaks rather than overhauling what works. He also feels that super seniors like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, and Jasprit Bumrah will always lead the charge and his job will be to be the sounding board as part of the support staff. ""We are quite lucky to have quality senior players and they will lead the charge.

""That's a good sign and hope we can build on that,"" Morkel said. He joined the pre-series camp in Bangladesh and currently, he wants to build trust with players and see how he can help them. ""For me, this is important to connect well with the guys, played a lot against some of the players, seen and connected with some of the guys during IPL and to be in the camp and form friendships and relationships with players is very important,"" said the former Proteas speedster. ""....trying to understand the guys and their strengths and weaknesses and help them set goals for the upcoming series."" He hoped that he can channelise the enormous level of talent that Indian cricketers possess. ""It's one thing having talent and skill and how can you make those guys feel welcome in an intimidating environment. India playing in blue shirt is a lot of expectations, so for me, having the experience, going through that, passing that sort of knowledge and helping them settle in will be the goal,"" Morkel said. ""As soon as players have that comfort and feel they belong here, that's when the performance comes. I am looking forward to that and obviously up-skill them and get them up to the standard. ""I understand that there will be expectations of winning and luckily I have experienced that in my playing days and I can share that knowledge,"" he added. Morkel said that after his discussions with the BCCI about the bowling coach's job were finalized, it took some time for the confirmation to sink in. ""So when I ended the call, I sat for about five minutes in the room. I spoke to my dad first and didn't even go to my wife. Normally, they say you tell the wife first, so quite a special moment for me,"" he said in jest. ""I enjoyed it 5-7 minutes with myself and then shared with the family about the opportunity and about eventually what might happen, so happy that we eventually got things over the line and this happened, looking forward to great journey and time with India."""
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/education/why-it-is-important-to-be-a-reflective-teacher/article68629042.ece,"""Madam, are you a robotic teacher or a reflective teacher?"" the principal asked the applicant, who had a decade of teaching experience. ""I am a reflective teacher,"" came the confident reply. Asked to elaborate, the explanation was: ""I raise questions and constantly reflect on why I became a teacher and why I choose to stay in this profession. I also review what I've taught in class regularly. Based on my reflections and student feedback, I strive to become a better teacher. Reflection, an integral part of my teaching philosophy, helps me check whether I am on the right path."" The principal's next question was more probing. ""Why did you leave your previous school?"" ""The school wanted me to be a mechanical, or rather, 'robotic' teacher,"" was the candid reply. ""I didn't feel comfortable working in that environment, so I decided to move."" When asked about the characteristics of a good teacher, educators, students and others may offer varying answers based on their perspectives. Qualities and skills such as the ability to build rapport with students, understanding, empathy, encouragement, effective communication, and subject knowledge are common but few consider that a good teacher is also a reflective one with a sound teaching philosophy. Two types There are two distinct types of teachers: robotic and reflective. They differ significantly in several key ways. The first views reflection as a burden and adhere strictly to predetermined procedures and lesson plans. The teaching style is mechanical and predictable, following instructions from supervisors without questioning their relevance or effectiveness. Like machines operating on commands, they perform tasks without engaging in critical thinking. These teachers show little interest in seeking student feedback on their lessons and fail to recognise that teaching and learning are distinct processes. Consequently, while they may cover the material, actual learning often does not occur. Robotic teachers are unwilling to assess whether there is a gap between what is taught and what is learned. Their rigid adherence to rules and routines stifles their creativity and limits their professional development. Unfortunately, in many educational institutions in India, teachers are required to follow a pre-programmed set of instructions and discouraged from thinking or acting independently. This lack of creativity and flexibility confines them to sticking strictly to textbooks. In contrast, reflective teachers are thoughtful individuals who recognise their professional strengths and weaknesses. They prioritise reflection, self-assessment, and ongoing professional growth and continuously evaluate the content they deliver, analyse their teaching methods based on reflection and student feedback, and are willing to adjust their approaches to better meet students' needs. These teachers believe that interactions with students are crucial for effective teaching and encourage student participation. By fostering an interactive classroom environment and focusing on students' needs and interests, they create a meaningful educational experience for their students and themselves. Reflective teachers regularly ask themselves questions such as: Am I doing the right thing in the classroom? Why am I doing what I am doing? What is my teaching philosophy? How effective is my teaching? Does my teaching have a positive impact on students? Key steps In today's era of artificial intelligence and constant connectivity, being reflective can be challenging. Nevertheless, taking time to reflect on teaching practices is crucial to find meaning in one's work and enhancing effectiveness. Reflective teachers follow three key steps--self-monitoring, self-assessment, and self-adjustment. Becoming a reflective teacher involves several key practices. First, teachers should cultivate curiosity. Just as curious children ask endless questions, teachers with a strong sense of curiosity remain engaged and thoughtful. This allows them to reflect more deeply on their teaching and become more effective educators. Developing a well-defined teaching philosophy is also essential. A Teaching Philosophy Statement (TPS) should address several core elements: why you chose to become a teacher, what your teaching goals are, how you strive to be an effective teacher, how you motivate your students, and how you plan to grow professionally. Although writing a TPS is not yet common practice in India, doing so and periodically reviewing it can be highly beneficial. A TPS helps teachers reflect on their motivations, strengths, limitations, goals, and the need for professional development. Another valuable practice is maintaining a Reflective Teaching Journal (RTJ). By regularly recording reflections and insights about their teaching practice, teachers can improve their teaching quality and overall professional skills by documenting experiences, tracking growth, and enhancing teaching effectiveness. Self-assessment is also crucial. Teachers should periodically evaluate their teaching practices by asking questions about their impact on students and their learning. Reflective teaching practices are vital for professional growth. Teachers who develop a critical perspective on their own teaching not only refine their skills but also positively influence their colleagues and students. It is often said that experience is the best teacher, but research has shown that experience alone doesn't guarantee learning. Instead, it is reflection on a particular experience that deepens one's understanding and enables informed decisions. As John Dewey famously said, ""We do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience."" The writer is an ELT resource person and education columnist. rayanal@yahoo.co.uk"

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/amid-grim-forecast-maldives-says-it-is-well-prepared-to-avert-default/article68641523.ece,"Despite global lenders and rating agencies flagging a ""high risk"" of debt distress in the Maldives, the government said it is well prepared to stave off a financial meltdown. Addressing Colombo-based journalists on Friday evening (September 13, 2024), Minister of Foreign Affairs Moosa Zameer and Minister of Finance Mohamed Shafeeq ruled out a possible default and pointed to ""crucial steps"" taken by the government towards fiscal consolidation and reform. Also read: India, Maldives hold defence dialogue focusing on Indian Ocean The top officials' assurance comes days after rating agency Moody's downgraded the island country's credit rating and warned of a full-blown debt crisis and possible default, amid looming deadlines for foreign debt servicing. President Mohamed Muizzu assumed office in November 2023 after a big election win -- he has a comfortable majority in Parliament or People's Majlis as well -- but currently faces a daunting challenge as the Indian Ocean archipelago grapples with high external debt. The Muizzu administration is taking advice from the International Monetary Fund, but there is no immediate plan to sign up for its programme, the Ministers said, expressing confidence that its bilateral partners would step in. China is the Maldives's largest creditor and India is another key lender. The two countries are financing a host of infrastructure projects that the government hopes will aid better connectivity and economic development. ""Both India and China are very sensitive to our challenge and are willing to help,"" Mr. Zameer said, pointing to ""many options"" on the table, including a possible debt freeze, currency swaps, and local currency settlements. ""We will discuss these as and when there is a need."" On Friday (September 13, 2024), the Maldives's Ministry of Economic Development & Trade signed an agreement with the People's Bank of China to establish a local currency settlement framework. Authorities are in talks with India for a similar arrangement. ""We are already taking all the necessary steps including reform of State-Owned Enterprises and our health sector. We are switching from blanket to targeted subsidies and rationalising our public expenditure,"" Mr. Shafeeq said. Following the downgrade by Moody's, the Finance Ministry said it was engaging with all its bilateral and multilateral partners to meet the financing requirements, and that a ""strong performance"" in the vital tourism sector was expected to boost growth. Tourist arrivals have seen an uptick in 2024. Chinese arrivals lead the list, contributing 12% of visitors, while arrivals from India declined sharply from 11% of visitors to 6%, the World Bank said in its May 2024 update. The period coincides with strained bilateral ties between India and the Maldives, on the heels of the ""India Out"" campaign around Mr. Muizzu's election last year, and amid controversial statements made by two junior ministers in his government that triggered a call to ""boycott Maldives"" within India. Emphasising that relations have since seen a marked improvement, Mr. Zameer said Indian tourist arrivals are ""picking up very well"" and the neighbours are keen to strengthen ties. ""We have had high-level engagement"", including External Affairs Minister Jaishankar's visit to the Maldives in August, and the countries' ""very pragmatic"" leaders have addressed the ""initial mistrust"", he said. President Muizzu is expected to travel to New Delhi soon on his first bilateral visit, although he has met Mr. Modi on the sidelines of other global meets and at Mr. Modi's swearing in ceremony this year. ""I think India-Maldives ties now are as good as they were during President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's time, which is considered the best time in our relationship,"" Mr. Zameer added."

According to a court statement on Friday, the lift was ordered because the amount transferred to Brazil reached the total X owed the country in fines, which had been imposed amid a feud between billionaire owner Elon Musk and Moraes. The judge has ordered access to the X social media platform blocked in Brazil, its sixth-biggest market, after X failed to comply with orders to block some accounts accused of spreading ""fake news"" and hate messages that the judge said were a threat to democracy. Musk, in turn, has challenged those orders, calling them ""censorship."" X also failed to name a local legal representative as required by Brazilian law and ignored a deadline for compliance with court orders, which led Moraes to order the freezing of Starlink's accounts in the country for possible use to cover fines owed by X. According to the Supreme Court, Moraes has not withdrawn his decision to block access to X in Brazil because it said the issue around a lack of legal representation has not been addressed, while content removals ordered by the judge have not been fulfilled. Musk, in addition to owning X and 40% of Starlink parent SpaceX, is the CEO of electric-vehicle maker Tesla."

Port Blair, the capital city of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, was renamed Sri Vijaya Puram. Andaman and Nicobar MP Bishnu Pada Ray of the BJP told PTI, ""It was a much-needed decision as the name Port Blair used to remind us of slavery during the British rule."" Andaman and Nicobar Territorial Congress's campaign committee chairman TSG Bhasker said it was unfortunate that the central government didn't bother to discuss the matter with the people of the island. ""They should have taken public opinion before renaming it. I strongly oppose the move,"" he said, dubbing it a ""meaningless decision"". People of the city expressed mixed reactions over the name change. While some welcomed it, others called it absurd. Announcing the renaming, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the earlier name had a colonial legacy, and Sri Vijaya Puram symbolised the victory achieved in India's freedom struggle and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' unique role in it. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have an ""unparalleled place"" in the freedom struggle and history, and the island territory that once served as the naval base of the Chola Empire is now poised to be the critical base for India's strategic and development aspirations, he added."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/openais-stunning-150-billion-valuation-hinges-on-upending-corporate-structure-sources-say/article68641515.ece,"OpenAI's new financing round is expected to come in the form of convertible notes, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who said its $150 billion valuation will be contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker can upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors. The details of the conditions of the $6.5 billion funding, which have not been previously reported, show how far OpenAI, the most valuable AI startup in the world, has come from a research-based non-profit, and the structural changes it's willing to make to attract ever more investment to fund its expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that surpasses human intelligence. The outsized funding round has seen strong investor demand and could be finalized in the next two weeks, given the rapid growth of OpenAI's revenue, sources added. Existing investors such as Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, as well as Microsoft are expected to participate. New investors including Nvidia and Apple also plan to invest. Sequoia Capital is also in talks to come back as a returning investor. If the restructuring is unsuccessful, OpenAI would need to renegotiate its valuation with investors at which their shares will be converted, likely at a lower number, sources told Reuters, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. Asked about the financing and potential change, OpenAI said in a statement that it remains focusing on building AI that benefits everyone while working with its non-profit board. ""The nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist,"" the company spokesperson said. The removal of the profit cap would require approval from OpenAI's non-profit board, consisting of Chief Executive Sam Altman, entrepreneur Bret Taylor and seven other members. The company has also held discussions with lawyers about turning its non-profit structure to a for-profit benefit corporation, similar to what its rivals such as Anthropic and xAI are using, sources added, confirming media reports. It is unclear if such fundamental corporate structural changes could happen. The removal of the profit cap, which put a limit on investors' potential returns in OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, would hand early investors an even bigger win. It could also raise questions about OpenAI's governance and departure from its non-profit mission. OpenAI has said the cap was put in place to ""incentivize them to research, develop, and deploy AGI in a way that balances commerciality with safety and sustainability, rather than focusing on pure profit-maximization."" The San Francisco-based AI lab, founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research project, with the goal of building AI for the benefit of humanity, is currently controlled by a non-profit parent organization. It has accelerated its commercialization efforts by selling subscription-based services like ChatGPT to consumers and enterprises, which now boasts over 200 million users. Existing investors are beholden to a capped limit to their return on investment, with any additional returns to be routed to the non-profit. Returns were capped at 100x the investment for investors in OpenAI's first round of financing. ""We expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds,"" the company said in a 2019 blog post detailing the structure. OpenAI used this model to raise more than $10 billion in recent years, with the majority coming from Microsoft. It was last valued at $80 billion in February in a tender offer deal where the company sold existing shares led by Thrive Capital."

European Union regulators are due to issue a decision with a hefty fine in the coming months after antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last year threatened to break up Google's lucrative adtech business. If this threat had been carried through in what would be a first for an antitrust case, it would have been the harshest regulatory penalty to date against Google, after Vestager charged it with favouring its own advertising services. But competition officials will likely not issue a breakup order because of the complexity involved, the people said. A break-up order could come at a later stage if Google continues its anti-competitive practices, they said, pointing to a precedent setting case involving Microsoft two decades ago. The European Commission's decision could evolve, they added. An EU decision is unlikely to come before Vestager leaves office in November, they said, but is still theoretically possible. The Commission and Google, which has racked up 8.25 billion euros ($9.14 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the last decade, declined to comment. Google's 2023 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $237.85 billion or 77% of total revenues. It is the world's dominant digital advertising platform. Vestager had suggested that Google could sell its sell-side tools DFP and its own ad exchange AdX because of the conflicts of interest as it also owns ad buying tools Google Ads and DV360, which places bids on ad exchanges. She said the company had allegedly illegally favoured its own ad exchange AdX in matching auctions, abusing its dominance since 2014. Google is currently the target of an antitrust trial brought by the U.S. Department of Justice which claims that it sought to monopolise markets for publisher ad servers and advertiser ad networks, and tried to dominate the market for ad exchanges which sit in the middle."

The effective duty on these crude and refined oils will increase from 5.5% to 27.5% and from 13.75% to 35.75%, respectively. ""These are big support for soya and oilseed farmers. Farmers from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will get hugely benefited as they account for significant production of these oil seeds,"" the official said. The official added that these measures were possible because of the effective management of the Government to contain domestic prices of edible oil, which have been falling continuously for nearly two years now. ""These are very smart moves by the Government to support soya farmers without affecting market sentiments,"" the official said. Besides Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, the other major oil seed-producing states are Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. The Government had previously fixed $550 per tonne as the Minimum Export Price (MEP), which essentially meant that farmers could not sell their produce overseas at a rate lower than this rate. A Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) notification issued on Friday (September 13, 2024) removed the MEP with immediate effect. The Government has also slashed the duty on onion exports to 20% from 40%. There is no export duty on 'Bangalore rose onion.' Last week, Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare noted that the outlook for onion availability and prices in coming months remains positive as the kharif (summer) sown area has increased sharply to 2.9 lakh hectare till August from 1.94 lakh hectare in the year-ago period. ""About 38 lakh tons of onions are reported to be still in storage with farmers and traders,"" she said. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal has said that with the removal of the MEP and reduction in export duty from 40% to 20%, onions can be exported in larger quantities. ""This decision, which will increase the income of farmers and exporters, will greatly encourage business in the agricultural sector,"" he said on social media platform X. On the removal of MEP on basmati rice, the Minister said that it would help increase exports and farmers' income."

According to the information given by the School Education department, the government has taken this decision after a dismal performance by the students of Class 10 in the 1000 CBSE schools, in an internal assessment test conducted to see their competency levels. Nearly 80,000 tabs were used for the test which produced results that were as alarming as disturbing. As many as 90% of the students failed in the assessment test.. In 326 schools, not a single student passed, 556 schools had 1-25 per cent pass percentage, 66 schools with 26-50 % of pass percentage, 37 schools with 51-75 % pass percentage, 14 schools with 76-99 % pass percentage and only one school with 100 % pass percentage. 59,518 of the total 77,478 students who took the English test, failed, 56,213 of the 77,478 students who wrote the mathematics test failed. In Science, out of the 77,478 students who wrote the test, 49,410 of them failed while 48,766 of the total 77,478 students failed in the Social Studies exam. Responding to the alarmingly low performance of the 10th class students, Minister for Human Resources Nara Lokesh expressed serious concern and called for coherence in the policies implemented in the education sector. After discussing the issue with officials of the School Education Department in a series of meetings, Mr. Lokesh announced that students of 10th class in these 1000 schools will write their final exams under the State Board system. He also directed the officials to bring about changes in the examination system from Class 6 from the academic year 2025-26 and put in place immediate initiatives to enhance the competency level of the students. Wary of the fact that if the students write their exam in CBSE system and fail, it may cause mental trauma to them, the Minister intends to give them more time for preparing well for the Central syllabus. Pointing to the fact that the 1000 schools were brought under CBSE syllabus in a most incoherent way, without imparting any training to teachers, he said a strong foundation level was needed to prepare the young learners for the Central syllabus. Mr. Lokesh also wants the officials to focus on capacity-building among teachers and students in accordance with the proposed changes in the exam system from Class 6 from the next academic year. He said lakhs of students had moved out of government schools in the State due to the haphazard policies of the earlier government. The education sector was in a mess, he said, citing the example of the introduction of TOEFL training for students with no teachers available to do the job. Same was the case with the policy of introduction of International Baccalaureate syllabus, he said. He said the officials should keep in mind the future of the students while implementing the proposed changes."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/irans-women-going-without-hijabs-as-2nd-anniversary-of-mahsa-aminis-death-approaches/article68641437.ece,"On the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, as the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches. There's no government official or study acknowledging the phenomenon, which began as Iran entered its hot summer months and power cuts in its overburdened electrical system became common. But across social media, videos of people filming neighbourhood streets or just talking about a normal day in their life, women and girls can be seen walking past with their long hair out over their shoulders, particularly after sunset. This defiance comes despite what United Nations investigators described as ""expanded repressive measures and policies"" by Iran's theocracy to punish them -- though there's been no recent catalysing event like Amini's death to galvanize demonstrators. The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. But the country's ultimate authority remains the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the past said ""unveiling is both religiously forbidden and politically forbidden."" For some observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab -- and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some -- has long been a political symbol as well. Also Read: Explained | Mahsa Amini and the widespread protests in Iran ""Meaningful institutional changes and accountability for gross human rights violations and crimes under international law, and crimes against humanity, remains elusive for victims and survivors, especially for women and children,"" warned a U.N. fact-finding mission on Iran on Friday (September 13). Amini, 22, died on Sept 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country's morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. The protests that followed Amini's death started first with the chant ""Women, Life, Freedom."" However, the protesters' cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against Khamenei. A monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. Today, passersby on the streets of Tehran, whether its tony northern suburbs for the wealthy or the working-class neighborhoods of the capital's southern reaches, now routinely see women without the hijab. It particularly starts at dusk, though even during the daylight on weekends women can be seen with their hair uncovered at major parks. Online videos -- specifically a sub-genre showing walking tours of city streets for those in rural areas or abroad who want to see life in the bustling neighborhoods of Tehran -- include women without the hijab. Something that would have stopped a person in their tracks in the decades follwing the 1979 Islamic Revolution now goes unacknowledged. ""My quasi-courage for not wearing scarves is a legacy of Mahsa Amini and we have to protect this as an achievement,"" said a 25-year-old student at Tehran Sharif University, who gave only her first name Azadeh out of fear of reprisal. ""She could be at my current age if she did not pass away."" The disobedience still comes with risk. Months after the protests halted, Iranian morality police returned to the streets. There have been scattered videos of women and young girls being roughed up by officers in the time since. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. Meanwhile, the government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars. The government has gone as far as use aerial drones to monitor the 2024 Tehran International Book Fair and Kish Island for uncovered women, the U.N. said. Yet some feel the election of Pezeshkian in July, after a helicopter crash killed Iranian hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, is helping ease tensions over the hijab. ""I think the current peaceful environment is part of the status after Pezeshkian took office,"" said Hamid Zarrinjouei, a 38-year-old bookseller. ""In some way, Pezeshkian could convince powerful people that more restrictions do not necessarily make women more faithful to the hijab."""
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/myanmar-junta-makes-rare-request-for-foreign-aid-to-cope-with-deadly-floods/article68641414.ece,"Myanmar's junta chief made a rare request Saturday (September 14, 2024) for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people who have already endured three years of war. Floods and landslides have killed almost 300 people in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which dumped a colossal deluge of rain when it hit the region last weekend. In Myanmar, more than 235,000 people have been forced from their homes by floods, the junta said Friday, piling further misery on the country where war has raged since the military seized power in 2021. In Taungoo -- around an hour south of the capital Naypyidaw -- residents paddled makeshift rafts on floodwaters lapping around a Buddhist pagoda. Rescuers drove a speedboat through the waters, lifting sagging electricity lines and broken tree branches with a long pole. ""I lost my rice, chickens, and ducks,"" said farmer Naung Tun, who had brought his three cows to higher ground near Taungoo after floodwaters innundated his village. ""I don't care about the other belongings. Nothing else is more important than the lives of people and animals,"" he told AFP. Flee by any means The rains in the wake of typhoon Yagi sent people across Southeast Asia fleeing by any means necessary, including by elephant in Myanmar and jetski in Thailand. ""Officials from the government need to contact foreign countries to receive rescue and relief aid to be provided to the victims,"" junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said on Friday, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. ""It is necessary to manage rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures as quickly as possible,"" he was quoted as saying. Myanmar's military has previously blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad. Last year it suspended travel authorisations for aid groups trying to reach around a million victims of powerful Cyclone Mocha that hit the west of the country. At the time the United Nations slammed that decision as ""unfathomable."" AFP has contacted a spokesperson for the UN in Myanmar for comment. After cyclone Nargis killed at least 138,000 people in Myanmar in 2008, the then-junta was accused of blocking emergency aid and initially refusing to grant access to humanitarian workers and supplies. 'Terrible experience' The junta gave a death toll on Friday of 33, while earlier in the day the country's fire department said rescuers had recovered 36 bodies. A military spokesman said it had lost contact with some areas of the country and was investigating reports that dozens had been buried in landslides in a gold-mining area in central Mandalay region. Military trucks carried small rescue boats to flood-hit areas around the military-built capital Naypyidaw on Saturday, AFP reporters said. ""Yesterday we had only one meal,"" Naung Tun said from near Taungoo. ""It is terrible to experience flooding because we cannot live our lives well when it happens."" ""It can be okay for people who have money. But for the people who have to work day to day for their meals, it is not okay at all."" More than 2.7 million people were already displaced in Myanmar by conflict triggered by the junta's 2021 coup. Vietnam authorities said Saturday that 262 people were dead and 83 missing. Images from Laos capital Vientiane, meanwhile, showed houses and buildings inundated by the Mekong river."

Danish authorities between the 1960s and the 1990s forced more than 4,500 young Inuit women to wear a contraceptive coil without their or their family's consent. The campaign was aimed at limiting the birth rate in the Arctic territory, which had not been a Danish colony since 1953 but was still under its control. Greenlandic, Danish and international experts have opened a probe into the legal aspects of the scandal, including violations of indigenous people's rights and consent issues. Its conclusions are due in mid-2025. Another enquiry mapping the historical aspects of the campaign is to present its conclusions around the same time. The scandal is one of many sensitive topics souring relations between Denmark and Greenland. The legal investigation ""is a necessary step in order to move forward,"" Greenland's Gender Equality Minister in charge of the case, Naaja Nathanielsen, said. ""Violations did take place. How can we frame it in a legal setting? That's what is being looked into right now. Maybe genocide, maybe not,"" she added. Human rights aspect ""An investigation would not be complete without looking into the human rights aspect, the indigenous rights aspect,"" Ms. Nathanielsen said. Nearly 150 women have sued the Danish state, and a trial could take place next year, according to their lawyer Mads Pramming. The coils rendered around half of the women sterile, and the large majority have physical and psychological scars.

Keeping in with Hyderabad parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi's announcement, AIMIM legislators, corporators and other functionaries were posted outside mosques in their respective constituencies. They encouraged the public to register their disapproval of the Bill. Incidents of those holding flex-banners on roadsides, urging motorists, to stop and scan the Q R code were also seen. Mentions of the Bill were made during the Friday (sermon). A Q R code was displayed in the courtyard of the historic Mecca Masjid. Similarly, announcements were made at other prominent places of worship such as the Masjid-e-Ghous-us-Saqlain in Kalapather. Maulana Husamuddin Sami made the announcement at the Jama Masjid Darul Shifa. Several volunteers handed flyers to the public which contained an explainer of the Bill, and reminded them that September 13 was the last day to send their objections or comments.

""The user you are trying to contact is receiving mail at a rate that prevents additional messages from being delivered. Please resend your message at a later time. If the user is able to receive mail at that time, your message will be delivered,"" these stated. AIMPLB president Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, along with Mr. Owaisi, met Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy. He sought to explain how the Bill, if passed, would adversely affect the Muslim community. Mr Owaisi had claimed that the Bill infringes on the freedom of religion. He also stated that the Bill was akin to stopping Muslim from worshipping."

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/c-lakshmanan-on-65-years-of-his-life-at-circus-gemini-circus/article68637386.ece,"Lakshmanan was in third grade when his parents took him to see a circus for the first time in the mid-1950s. He went to catch the Great Eastern Circus in his hometown Thalassery, in Kannur district, famed as the City of Three Cs - cake, cricket and circus. One of the memories that is still fresh in his mind as he witnessed that spectacle is the sight of a young woman who was twirled and lifted by an elephant with its trunk, in a show of strength and skill as a packed crowd cheered. Today, as Lakshmanan stands tall in the circus ring as a trainer at Gemini Circus, boasting decades of experience in and around the country, he is accompanied by neither the beast nor the cheer. ""The circus is in a decline, and I don't think we might be able to sustain it for more than two years,"" says 77-year-old Chakiyath Lakshmanan, who has been working in the industry for 65 years. Established in 1951, Gemini Circus founded by MV Shankaran and K Sahadevan, had its maiden performance on August 15, in Bilimora, Gujarat. This iconic establishment entertained guests of honour such as the former prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., Russia's Valentina Tereshkova (first woman in space) and many more. However, today this circus camp is one of the few surviving souvenirs of a bygone era, with only seven major circus companies surviving in India as of 2020. Lakshmanan's journey as a circus artist began when he knocked on the doors of Shankaran. ""I used to live right next to him. I went to his house and asked whether I could join,"" he recalls. Lakshmanan adds that his father was ready to disown his son when he wanted to join the circus. ""We were not rich; he knew that life would be difficult in the camp and that I might be punished by the trainers during practice,"" he adds. Slowly, yet steadily Lakshmanan climbed the ranks from a clown to a trapeze artist to a seesaw acrobat and so on for a starting salary of Rs50, he remembers. His ability to do handstands made him an integral cog in the wheel, as he also trained his juniors at the camp. In 1980, Lakshmanan left Gemini Circus for the Great Royal Circus of India in Brunei, Malaysia. ""I was there for nearly three years,"" he says, before he managed to come back to India to reunite with his wife, Kamala, and his family. ""The atmosphere was great and there were a lot of gymnastic acts there. I learnt new training techniques and bonded with the gymnastics coach,"" recollects Lakshmanan. He joined Venus Circus as a trainer and then moved to Apollo Circus after his return from Malaysia. From there he shifted to Jumbo Circus, where he stayed for five years before he went back to the Apollo Circus due to a difference of opinion with the management. A few years later, he got a call from Gemini Circus. ""Since then, I have been working in Gemini and Jumbo circuses for the last 33 years,"" says Lakshmanan. The veteran was able to bring a lot more to the ring after his stint in Malaysia. One of his creations was a routine he called Akashayathra, an aerial act reminiscent of floating angels. ""There were two catchers and the performer would be dangling from the ceiling and get hoisted by a helper,"" he says. The main performer or 'the angel' would be doing stunts while dangling down. It was all performed in a well-lit stage, he adds. However, with the turn of the new millennium, the circus has been fighting an uphill battle against modern forms of entertainment. The circus community was also affected by the ban on using animals at circuses and on employing people under 18. ""In olden days, children aged eight and 10 used to join circus camps,"" he says. Even the Kerala state government's efforts to revive the circus went in vain as the government-funded Kerala Circus Academy in Thalassery established in 2010 was shut down in 2016, unable to pay its coaches or staff in a town that boasts a legacy going back to the 1800s. The same town where Keeleri Kunhikannan, known as the father of the Indian circus, started his Circus Training Hall in 1888, is no longer keen on producing circus artists. ""There's nothing left in Thalassery for circus. Back then there used to be circus training in the city, those don't happen anymore,"" he rues. Lakshmanan believes government support is necessary for this art form to rejuvenate. He points out how several of the retired artists including his wife do not receive the pension of Rs1,600 from the Kerala government. He adds, ""Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy used to have an insurance policy for circus artists which was stopped. It has caused us a lot of disappointment, especially for old people like me..."" For Lakshmanan, this trade has helped him educate his two sons Nishant and Nishil, get them married, buy a house and save some money. This he deems as his greatest achievement after so many years into the industry. He says, ""There are a lot of people like me in Thalassery... There are many people who have not been fortunate to have that, I am happy for whatever I have received. Catch Gemini Circus at Putharikandam Maidan, Thiruvananthapuram, till September 30"

Back in 2019, EU-wide elections held in the wake of massive youth climate marches saw a surge of support for the Greens, who captured more than 70 seats in the European Parliament. This June, by contrast, the Greens shed 20 seats in a vote marked by gains for the right and far right. For Luke Haywood of the European Environmental Bureau NGO federation, the writing is on the wall - he expects the shift in Parliament may relegate the EU's climate ambitions to the backburner. ""There is a risk that there will be an attempt to ignore the long-term benefits that we all have of acting on climate now, focusing on short-term gains for certain industries,"" he said. Climate loomed large under the outgoing Commission, which drove through an ambitious legislative ""Green Deal"" including flagship measures such as a ban on new combustion engine cars from 2035.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/livingstone-whacks-england-to-a-series-tying-t20-win-over-australia/article68641376.ece,"Liam Livingstone and Jacob Bethell shared 90 runs off 47 balls to lead England to a Twenty20 series-tying win over Australia at Sophia Gardens. The series winner will be decided on Sunday (September 15, 2024) at Old Trafford. Set 194 to win, England slipped to 79-3 when Phil Salt walked into an apparent trap laid by fellow stand-in captain Travis Head, holing out to Matthew Short, but Livingstone and Bethell broke the back of the chase. Bethell's dismissal for 44 off 24 balls with the finish line in sight disrupted England but Livingstone carried them to the brink of victory with a superb 87 off 47, including five sixes and six fours. He was bowled with the scores tied and Brydon Carse senselessly slogged in the air next ball to give part-timer Short, who had previously taken only two international wickets, a shock maiden professional five-wicket haul. However, Adil Rashid steered to backward point for the single England needed for a three-wicket win with six balls to spare and to tie the series 1-1. Livingstone, in his 50th T20, earlier took 2-16 from three overs while Carse, barely a fortnight on from his return to cricket after a three-month ban for breaching betting regulations, also impressed with a couple of wickets as he filled in for Jofra Archer, breaching 90 mph (145 kph). Head, the skipper in the absence of an ill Mitch Marsh, was again electric at the top of the order with 31 off 14 balls while Jake Fraser-McGurk's 50 -- his first international fifty -- was followed by Australia plundering 60 from the final five overs to finish on 193-6. Salt began the reply initially watchful, then belted three successive leg-side sixes off Aaron Hardie before Sean Abbott silenced the crowd with two wickets in three balls. Will Jacks under-cooked a pull on 12 and Abbott's nip-backer breached Jordan Cox's defences. Livingstone was beaten by a beauty first up and then survived a review for lbw in an eventful over. Undeterred, Livingstone cleared deep midwicket off Marcus Stoinis then got some payback on Abbott with three fours in an over as England closed to within two of Australia's powerplay score, aided by a couple of fumbles on the rope by Fraser-McGurk. Head's gamble to introduce Short's part-time off-spin reaped rewards, with Salt miscuing to fall for 39 off 23 balls. Requiring 104 from the last 10 overs, Livingstone put the hammer down, scooping Cameron Green for six before twice depositing Stoinis into the crowd for a 27-ball fifty. Bethell got into the act with a swing off slow left-armer Cooper Connolly before taking down Australia's premier spinner Adam Zampa. Bethell, in just his second T20, used his feet brilliantly to disrupt Zampa's rhythm and took him for 4-6-4-4. But with 25 needed off the last four overs, he missed a reverse sweep off Short. Short snared Curran in the same over and while Livingstone belted a six then a four off the spinner to level the scores, both he and Carse blotted their copybook before Rashid got England home."

It is spanking new, and yet, retains the charm of its previous life: such as the large wooden windows above which stand rectangular transom windows. The building is 110 years old, and was the first one to come up in the campus of the YMCA on Head Post Office Road. It has now been renovated in tune with the architecture of the original. The YMCA campus is known for its basketball court and gym that many people in the city frequent. ""It is here that the city's first tennis court came up,"" says Joseph Ratnam, a board member, adding that many Britishers and the city's mill-owners would frequent the courts, that are still in good condition. The main building, according to the association's president E Jeyakumar David, is spread across 4,000 sqft inside the 2.87-acre campus. ""Since it is over a century old, we thought it needed to be maintained,"" explains the 70-year-old Joseph, adding that they felt that by doing so, they were honouring the legacy of their seniors. Thus began the task of renovating the heritage building; all of the members were bent on one thing: that they do not demolish it, and instead, strengthen the structure from the base. Joseph, who worked in the banking sector, takes me around the building, the ground floor of which is home to over 10 rooms that have been rented out to commercial establishments. The YMCA was established in Coimbatore in 1911 by Sir Robert Stanes, and the building's construction was completed in 1913. The hall, explains Joseph, has hosted events for children and adults over the years, its walls reverberating with the voices of choir singers young and old. ""It used to be a popular spot for choir rehearsals,"" he recalls, adding that several groups from the city would use it to train. ""It has seen youth meetings of the YMCA, and in the 70s and 80s, it was also used to stage musicals,"" he adds. Their archives have black-and-white photos of their past events with children in charming costumes and strapping basketball players posing with their teams in front of the building. The original had a tiled roof, a stone staircase and also a wooden flight of stairs. All of these elements had to go though, owing to their condition. The stone sunshade landings that stood over the old parapet are still in place, including the wooden doors and windows. ""When we started on the woodwork, we found that the wood in the original was alive and breathing, and hence retained it after giving it a good polishing,"" points out Joseph. The hall on the first floor, he says, will now be rented out for events that conform to the ethics of the YMCA. The small rooms at the ground floor still have the wooden rafters on the roofs, reminders of the building's older times. After a brief stroll, we stop at a corner on the first floor, from where we get a good view of the campus's defining aspects: the tennis courts, gym, and the basketball court. For the members, this building carries several memories that they hope to preserve for years to come."

Investigators stormed 20 charity shelters across two Malaysian states on Wednesday, arresting 171 suspects including religious studies teachers and caregivers, and bringing to safety over 400 children. In what is believed to be the worst such case to hit Malaysia in decades, police suspect the victims -- aged from one to 17 -- had been subjected to sexual and physical attacks. They were also allegedly forced by the care home staff to abuse each other. Investigators were ""working towards"" further raids and arrests as the probe on the organisation called Global Ikhwan Services and Business (GISB) continued, said police inspector-general Razarudin Husain. Investigations and health checks so far show that at least 13 minors had been sexually abused, Razarudin said at a press conference. The children, who are temporarily being housed in a police training centre in Kuala Lumpur among other locations, are still undergoing medical examinations, added the police chief. Razarudin had said on Wednesday that children as young as five were burnt with hot spoons, while others who were ill were not allowed to seek treatment until their condition became critical. ""The caretakers also touched the children's bodies as if to carry out medical checks,"" he said. GISB has denied the allegations and said they do not run the care homes raided in the states of Selangor and Negeri Sembilan.

Multi-ethnic Malaysia has a dual-track legal system, with Muslims subject to sharia (Islamic law) in certain areas. DNA samples GISB has long been controversial for its links to the now-defunct Al-Arqam sect and has faced scrutiny by religious authorities in the Muslim-majority country. Al-Arqam was banned by the authorities in 1994 for deviant teachings, while GISB members had in 2011 set up an ""Obedient Wives Club"" that called on women to be ""whores in bed"" to stop their husbands from straying. According to its website, GISB says it is an Islamic company that runs businesses from supermarkets to restaurants, and operates in several countries including Indonesia, France and the United Kingdom. Police believe the 402 minors in the care homes were all children of GISB members, Razarudin told AFP on Thursday. ""We feel that there's a need for DNA samples to be taken."" Religious authorities in Selangor state said this week they were closely monitoring GISB's activities. ""[We] remain vigilant about any facts leading to deviations from true Islamic teachings,"" they said. The United Nations children's agency underlined the ""unimaginable horror"" faced by the victims. The children ""will need long-term professional medical and psychosocial support,"" said Robert Gass, UNICEF's Malaysia representative. The case has also rattled locals.

""By strengthening Hindi, all these languages will also become flexible and prosperous and with the practice of integration, all languages will also take forward our culture, history, literature, grammar and the 'sanskar',"" he said in a video message.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-paints-kamala-harris-red-in-quest-for-votes-in-the-last-lap-of-presidential-race/article68641310.ece,"""Everyone knows she's a Marxist,"" Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has repeated loudly and often, referring to his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, who he is hoping to tar with one of the oldest brushes in the U.S. political playbook. The aim? To portray Harris as a dangerous left-wing extremist, and to invoke the infamous Cold War-era ""red scare"" in the United States. In recent weeks, the former president has stepped up his rhetoric against the Vice President, describing her as both a ""Marxist"" and a ""communist"" at almost every opportunity. Ms. Harris has not directly addressed the taunts, but her policies over decades of holding public office do not appear to conform to either the 19th-century German theorist's views or the various left-wing schools of thought that followed him. ""She's not a Marxist, she's not a communist,"" said Thomas Zeitzoff, a professor at American University and a specialist on political violence. For the Republican camp, using such terms is ""a way of trying to say that she's extreme,"" he told AFP. Mr. Trump, experts say, is using an age-old US political tactic called ""red-baiting,"" which aims to discredit an opponent by accusing them of not being a capitalist. Paranoia The strategy involves labelling an opponent as a ""communist,"" ""socialist,"" ""Marxist,"" or a ""red,"" said Barbara Perry, a Presidential studies professor at the University of Virginia. It is ""an attempt not only to denigrate them, but also to get them to fight back and maybe present themselves in a not very nice way,"" she added. Ms. Perry said the terms were ""very weighted"" in the United States, and invoke the repeated ""red scares"" of the era following the two world wars, when Washington was competing with the Soviet Union for dominance. ""The country tends to turn inward at those times"" of competition with a rival ideology, she said. The most well-known example of the ""red scare"" phenomenon was practiced by U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, the chief ""red baiter and the witch hunter in the Senate,"" Perry said. A fervent anti-communist, McCarthy warned of the supposed infiltration of communists into every stratum of American society, creating a widespread climate of paranoia across the country. ""Red baiting also has this... long history in the US, and it's kind of interesting to see it sort of come back,"" said Zeitzoff. He also identified a common thread running between McCarthy and Trump: a lawyer named Roy Cohn. Mr. Cohn was an advisor to McCarthy, and in the 1970s became a mentor to the real estate magnate and future president of the United States, Mr. Trump. Narrow margins Ms. Harris only became the Democratic Party's Presidential candidate in July, after President Joe Biden dramatically dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate performance against Trump. With voters having a limited time to get to know the vice president, Trump has attempted to influence their image by repeatedly characterizing her as a communist. To explain why Mr. Trump has done this, both Zeitzoff and Perry use the same metaphor: of throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks. Mr. Trump appears to be trying to attract a certain type of voters by calling Ms. Harris a ""Marxist,"" said Zeitzoff, particularly Hispanic and Latino Americans. Many voters from that background may have come from families that fled communist countries and therefore have unfavorable views of them. Mr. Trump is also targeting another demographic with this rhetoric: older voters. ""There will be some people in the electorate who are remembering, as I can... the height of the Cold War,"" Perry said. ""So there will be, certainly, people who know that communism is bad and think communism is bad to this day."" In his book ""Nasty Politics,"" Zeitzoff argued that the use of insults, conspiracy theories and aggressive rhetoric was not particularly effective in influencing voters to change camps. Nevertheless, with the current election on a knife edge -- the candidates are neck-and-neck in most polls, including in battleground states -- Mr. Trump's red baiting could make a difference. ""The margins are really narrow. So maybe this, you know, is persuadable to some people at the edge,"" Zeitzoff said."
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gunman-says-he-heard-killing-voices-before-colorado-supermarket-shooting/article68641296.ece,"A mentally ill man who killed 10 people at a Colorado supermarket told psychologists he heard ""killing voices"" right before opening fire, a psychologist testified Friday during the gunman's trial. Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, who has been diagnosed with a severe case of schizophrenia, repeatedly failed during about six hours of interviews to provide any more details about the voices or whether he heard them saying anything other than that they were yelling, forensic psychologist B. Thomas Gray said. ""I started hearing voices, like killing, like killing voices,"" Alissa said in one portion of the videotaped interviews shown in court. The clips showed Alissa fidgeting, yawning and stretching at times and speaking in a soft voice that was often difficult to hear over a hum on the recordings. After the interviews, Mr. Gray and fellow forensic psychologist Loandra Torres determined that at the time of the 2021 shooting in the college town of Boulder, Alissa was legally sane -- able to understand the difference between right and wrong. No one, including Alissa's lawyers, disputes he was the shooter. Alissa has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting. The defence says he should be found not guilty because he was insane and not able to tell the difference between right and wrong at the time of the shooting. In questioning Mr. Gray, one of Alissa's attorneys, Kathryn Herold, pointed out that Mr. Gray and Ms. Torres did not have full confidence in their finding, largely because Alissa did not provide them more information about what he was experiencing even though that could have helped his case. She noted they were relying on a man with treatment-resistant schizophrenia experiencing hallucinations to explain what was happening to him. Alissa also said he was planning to die in the attack so he would not have to go to jail, Mr. Gray said. Herold pointed out that Alissa surrendered instead. Alissa stripped down to his underwear before he was arrested in the store, apparently to show he was no longer armed and not a threat. Alissa is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, multiple counts of attempted murder and other offenses, including having six high-capacity ammunition magazine devices banned in Colorado after previous mass shootings. Testimony on Alissa's sanity is expected to wrap up Monday. The defence will then start to present its case, which is set to include calling Alissa's relatives as witnesses."
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kamala-harris-says-she-is-different-from-biden-claims-she-offers-a-new-generation-of-leadership/article68641288.ece,"Vice President Kamala Harris, who presents herself as the candidate of change as she runs for President against Republican Donald Trump, said on Friday (September 13, 2024) that she's different from President Joe Biden because she offers ""a new generation of leadership"". In her first solo television interview, since she became the Democratic Presidential nominee, Ms. Harris also criticised the ""hate and division that we see coming out of Donald Trump"". She said she thinks people are ""exhausted"" by his style of leadership. Also Read: Key takeaways from Donald Trump-Kamala Harris debate She also said she's a gun owner and doesn't want to take away anyone's guns, but she believes a ban on assault-style weapons is necessary and consistent with the Second Amendment. Anchor Brian Taff of WPVI-TV in Philadelphia asked Ms. Harris to describe one or two areas where she's different from the President. ""Well, I'm obviously not Joe Biden"" and ""I offer a new generation of leadership,"" Ms. Harris said, adding that things once taken for granted cannot be overlooked anymore. ""For example, another plan that I have that is a new approach is to expand the child tax credit to $6,000 for young families for the first year of their child's life because that is obviously a very critical stage of development of child, and so my approach is about new ideas, new policies that are directed at the current moment,"" she said. ""And also, to be very honest with you, my focus is very much on what we need to do over the next 10, 20 years to catch up to the 21st century around, again, capacity but also challenges."" The interview was conducted in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, as Ms. Harris campaigned there Friday (September 13). Donald Trump, his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance and other Republicans have criticised Ms. Harris for largely avoiding media interviews or interacting on the record with reporters who cover her campaign events. She and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, gave a joint interview to CNN last month. Her campaign recently said she will begin to do more local interviews, and the National Association of Black Journalists announced Friday that some of its members will interview Ms. Harris on Tuesday (September 17, 2024) in Philadelphia. Ms. Harris used a question about the former president's appeal and how she would speak to his supporters to criticise Trump and his leadership style. ""I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,"" she said. The Vice President suggested that her support from Republican officials, including former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, is a result of people being ""exhausted"" with Mr. Trump. ""I think people are more willing now, in light of the hate and division that we see coming out of Donald Trump to say, Hey, let's put country first' and I think that just makes us stronger and more healthy as a country,"" she said. Mr. Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The Vice President, 59, is a former San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, and U.S. senator. She offered a few answers when asked to share one thing she would like people to know about her they don't yet know. ""Probably it's not very different from anybody watching right now,"" she said. ""I love my family. One of my favourite things that I lately have not been able to do is Sunday family dinner. I love to cook."" Ms. Harris also said her best friend from kindergarten ""is still my best friend""."
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-pledges-to-deport-haitians-from-ohio-city-biden-calls-for-attacks-to-stop/article68641262.ece,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged to conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city of Springfield shortly after President Joe Biden on Friday (September 13, 2024) called on the attacks on the community to cease. The city for days has found itself at the centre of a social media maelstrom after right-wing agitators latched onto false claims that Haitian arrivals were eating household pets. ""We will do large deportations in Springfield, Ohio,"" Mr. Trump said at a press conference at his golf resort near Los Angeles. Mr. Trump did not repeat the assertion he made during Tuesday's presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that immigrants were eating dogs and cats, remarks that have been widely mocked. The majority of the 15,000 Haitians in Springfield are there legally. Trump's longstanding pledge to conduct mass deportations usually refers to those in the country illegally. Two elementary schools were evacuated and one middle school in Springfield was closed on Friday after anonymous bomb threats were made against the community for the second day in a row, according to ABC News. At the White House, Mr. Biden urged the attacks on the Haitian community to stop. ""It's simply wrong. There's no place in America. This has to stop - what he's doing. It has to stop,"" Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trump has cited the tensions in Springfield as another example of the need for hardline immigration polices. The influx of Haitians has boosted the economy but also has strained social services. Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield. ""We need help, not hate,"" Springfield's mayor, Rob Rue, told ABC News. City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of ""crimes of opportunity,"" such as property theft."
The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/budameru-flood-crisis-tracing-the-causes-of-a-catastrophe/article68638554.ece,"The devastating floods in Vijayawada city, caused by breaches in the Budameru rivulet, has highlighted a multitude of issues ranging from government neglect and lack of commitment on the part of successive governments to finding a permanent solution. What is most telling is the fact that the State government still lacks comprehensive data on the encroachments along the drain, despite a recurring pattern of the rivulet inundating entire swathes of farmland and residential areas along its course over the years. In 1956, leaders from the Socialist Party and the Congress Party launched a movement to draw attention to the hardships faced by the people whenever the Budameru overflowed. Since then, every political party has staged protests and agitations while in the opposition, but has done little to address the issue once in power. The recommendations of expert committees, such as the Mitra Committee in 1966, were largely ignored, with the exception of the construction of a head regulator at Velagaleru in G. Konduru mandal in 1970. For decades, officials of the Water Resources Department (WRD) ignored the encroachments on the Budameru drain and its floodplains. Other government departments, such as revenue and local administration, have also failed to act, allowing these illegal developments to continue. Residential areas have been built with the tacit approval of these government agencies. To circumvent legal issues, survey numbers from land parcels near the Budameru floodplain were used in land registrations, rather than from within the floodplain itself, in areas like Ramakrishnapuram, parts of Ajith Singh Nagar, Rajarajeswaripeta, and Ayodhya Nagar. With flood levels remaining below 15,000 cusecs over the last two decades, encroachments have become increasingly widespread, and rapid urbanisation has taken hold in these floodplain areas. The consequences of unchecked greed have been severe, as the Budameru drain reclaimed its floodplains, which have gradually shrunk over the decades. For the first time since 2005, the waters of Budameru surged into the city, flooding streets and inundating homes and other structures built on its plains. The flooding caused losses amounting to thousands of crores of rupees in the encroached areas. The diversion channel, constructed in 2006-07, failed to manage the situation. In the first week of September, the Krishna River saw an unprecedented flow of over 11 lakh cusecs. The Polavaram Right Canal could not discharge the Budameru waters because the river's water level was higher than that of the canal, causing a rebound effect, with around 50,000 cusecs of water rushing back into the city at tremendous speed. The diversion channel was intended to direct the Budameru floodwaters into the Polavaram Right Canal, which has a capacity of 37,500 cusecs and ultimately empties into the Krishna River. Instead, the Budameru water was diverted to the Krishna River via the Vijayawada Thermal Power Station (VTPS) without constructing a new canal. However, the Polavaram Right Canal is designed to handle a maximum flow of 37,500 cusecs, far less than the 70,000 cusecs of floodwater that inundated Vijayawada this time. With no feasible way to increase the capacity of the existing cooling canal at VTPS, the necessary work has been stalled for the past 20 years. While the annual average rainfall for the entire Krishna district is 98 cm, the Budameru catchment area received an astonishing 33 cm of rain in just 36 hours this year, leading to severe flooding. The problem typically occurs when the Budameru catchment experiences more than average rainfall within a 24-48 hour period. This causes the reservoir in Velagaleru village to reach critical levels, forcing the irrigation department to release water and triggering floods in Vijayawada. Additionally, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the bathymetry and width of the drain. Significant floods were caused by heavy rains in 1989, 1990, 1991, 2005, and 2009. The total discharges from the Budameru Diversion Channel (BDC) and Budameru course have varied from 3,722 cusecs in 1971 to 39,595 cusecs in 1964, with notable discharges of 26,080 cusecs in 1969, 34,996 cusecs in 1986, and 32,273 cusecs in 1990. The maximum capacity of the Budameru drain is 11,000 cusecs. To manage this strong flow, a head regulator was built at Velagaleru in G. Konduru mandal in 1970, allowing the Water Resources Department (WRD) to control the floodwaters. Later, the Budameru Diversion Channel (BDC) was constructed to prevent flooding in the northern residential areas of Vijayawada, including New Rajarajeswaripet, Nandamuri Nagar, Nunna, Payakapuram, Singh Nagar, and Devi Nagar. The primary purpose of the BDC is to divert excess water from the Budameru into the Krishna at Pavitra Sangamam near Ibrahimpatnam. Additionally, the Vijayawada Thermal Power Station (VTPS) discharges wastewater into the river through the BDC. Subsequently, the Polavaram Right Canal was connected with Budameru to link the Polavaram project with the Krishna. While the Polavaram canal is designed for a capacity of 37,500 cusecs, its current capacity is only 8,500 cusecs. For the past eight years, water from the Pattiseema project has been channelled into the Krishna River through this canal. Speaking to The Hindu, Water Resources Minister Nimmala Ramanaidu said the State government would develop an action plan for a permanent solution to the flooding issues. The current capacity of BDC is 15,000 cusecs, which is set to be increased to 35,000 cusecs. The government will also consider the capacity of the Polavaram canal, as it receives water from the Pattiseema project. Additionally, the focus will shift to managing the Budameru's course from Enikepadu to Kolleru Lake. WRD officials have been asked to submit a report on the encroachments on irrigation lands, and 'Operation Budameru' will be initiated at a later stage, he added. Despite the persistent problem of Budameru flooding, WRD officials currently have no information on encroachments. Superintending Engineer P. Gangaiah admitted, ""We don't have any information on the encroachments. We are yet to conduct a study."" It is worth noting that the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) identified these issues in its City Development Plan (CDP) of 2011. The CDP clearly stated that indiscriminate blocking of the Budameru drain by developments and encroachments has led to significant problems, including loss of property, health issues, and sometimes loss of life. The CDP highlights indiscriminate human activities such as trespassing and construction within the Budameru flood zone. Out of the city's 59 divisions, 26 are flood-affected, with eight divisions impacted by floods in the Krishna and 18 by Budameru floods. The reality is that neither the WRD nor the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has taken any effective steps to remove the encroachments. In 2005, the Budameru recorded floodwaters of about 70,000 cusecs. Political parties then rallied on behalf of the victims in Vijayawada, and CPI-affiliated farmers' union leader Kolli Nageswara Rao spearheaded a large-scale awareness campaign to explain the causes of the flooding. At that time, Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy proposed that diverting the rivulet away from the city was the only viable solution. YSR, as he was popularly known, had suggested that officials adjust the alignment of the Polavaram project's right canal to address the issue of floodwaters and ensure a permanent solution for Vijayawada's drinking water needs. Consequently, as part of the Polavaram project, the downstream flow of Budameru was redirected into the right canal by 2007-08. Political parties in power have long permitted encroachments, using neighbouring land parcel survey numbers for registrations, keeping in mind real estate interests. Approximately 20 years ago, this part of the city was sparsely populated, but it has since transformed into a bustling area with marketplaces and residential colonies, many of which have been built on floodplains. To mitigate flooding, modernisation of the canal and an increase in its capacity were deemed essential. Numerous agitations have taken place over the years, yet efforts to resolve the issue permanently have largely been overshadowed by political manouevring, resulting in the issue becoming a persistent curse for the city. Proposals worth Rs500 crore for the modernisation of the Budameru canal were halted midway. The canal runs through areas such as Bhavanipurm, Vidyadharapuram, Ayodhya Nagar, Madhura Nagar, and Kanaka Durga Colony, parallel to the Eluru Canal. Due to high demand for residential plots, land adjacent to the drain was illegally occupied. Political parties have largely ignored these encroachments while engaging in a campaign of mudslinging. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has accused the previous YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) administration of neglecting the Budameru issue for five years. They claim that the YSRCP government cancelled work orders for strengthening the bunds of Budameru, which could have prevented the disaster. In turn, former Chief Minister and YSRCP president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy criticised the current government for opening the gates of the Velagaleru Regulator without warning the public. The flood victims, meanwhile, silently go about the task of cleaning up their homes and colonies, aware that a solution to their travails is not going to come any time soon."

The central probe agency had appealed to the city-based Sealdah court, seeking permission to conduct the test on Roy. ""The accused did not agree to undergo the narco analysis test when the judge asked him about it,"" the officer said. The CBI was planning to conduct the narco test on Roy to cross-check his version in the case. The accused was earlier brought to the Sealdah court, where the judge spoke to him personally to find out whether he had any objection to the test. During a narco analysis test, the drug -- sodium pentothal -- is injected into the body of the subject, which takes him to a hypnotic state, and his imagination is neutralised, the CBI officer said. ""In most cases, the accused gives the true information,"" the officer said. The CBI has already conducted a polygraph test on Roy inside the Presidency Correctional Home. Meanwhile, a CBI team on Thursday went to the R.G. Kar hospital, where the body of the postgraduate trainee was found on August 9, and spoke to several officers besides visiting departments as a part of its investigation.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-are-am-fm-and-signal-modulation-explained/article68641239.ece,"When you tune in to the radio, the announcer says, ""Welcome to 100.1 FM Gold"" or ""You are listening to Akashvani at 783 AM"". The terms 'AM' and 'FM' refer to forms of signal modulation -- a method at the heart of modern long-distance communications. Signal modulation simplifies the technologies required to send and receive good-quality signals carrying information, like the news and songs on the radio. How do we 'measure' waves? Imagine a vast, quiet lake. The water is as still as a statue. At the centre of the lake is a small island of pebbles. You pick up and drop a pebble into the water. A single wave ripples across the lake, forming a circle that expands in all directions. That is: a single, short disruption triggered the release of a single wave. After the wave passed, the lake became quiet again. If you dropped a small gravel, the resulting wave would have had a short height. If the stone had been heavier, the impact would have been more energetic and the wave would have been taller. This height is called the wave's amplitude. A high amplitude sound wave will be louder; a high amplitude light wave will be brighter. Dropping a stone every second will create a series of waves, traversing the surface one after another in concentric circles. If I'm sitting in a boat at some distance from the tower, and the wave strikes the boat, it will heave up and down. By measuring how much the boat is lifted, I can calculate the amplitude and from that the weight of the rock you dropped. I can also determine how frequently you drop new stones by counting how often my boat seesaws The number of successive crests arriving at a spot per second is the wave's frequency, measured in hertz (Hz). One Hz equals one cycle per second. This means the Chennai Akashvani radio station produces radio waves with 783,000 crests in one second. The interval between two successive crests (or troughs) is called the wavelength, measured in metres. What are FM and AM? Suppose we agree to use the Morse code: two stones dropped in quick succession equals a dot (*) and a longer gap between two stones is a dash (-). When two stones are dropped one after the other, the waves are closely spaced, resulting in a higher frequency. If we drop the pebbles with a big time gap, the frequency drops. By monitoring the frequency of the incoming waves far from the shore, I can distinguish between * and -. And based on the series of * and -, I can decipher the message. This technique of information communication is called frequency modulation (FM). Here, we modulate, or adjust, the frequency to transmit a message. We can also agree to another code: a heavy stone indicates a * and a light stone indicates a -. To convey * - * * * - * (Morse for 'air'), you drop heavy, light, heavy, heavy, heavy, light, heavy in that order, at regular intervals. The resulting waves will have varying amplitudes: tall, short, tall, tall, tall, short, tall. I can figure out the pattern by observing how much my boat sways and decipher your message. This is amplitude modulation (AM). You fix the frequency by dropping the stones at fixed intervals. Instead you change the pebbles' weight, resulting in waves of different amplitudes. What is phase modulation? We can have two waves with the same frequencies but different phases, meaning one wave starts slightly later than the previous one. It's like in march-past in which one set of people are out of step. So the corresponding crests (or troughs) of the waves will be slightly out of phase. When a crest meets another crest, they combine and become more prominent. When a crest hits a trough, they cancel out. This way, out-of-phase waves can be made to stack up uniquely to produce a bigger wave. People use the phase difference between two waves of the same frequency to encode a message. The advantage of PM is that slight changes in the signal amplitude won't degrade the information it carries. This is because the modulating signal is not transmitted by the amplitude of the pulses, so pulse modulation is nearly impervious to amplitude fluctuations produced by interference and noise. This is why operators choose PM over AM or FM for crystal-clear digital transmission, such as in Wi-Fi. What are digital and analog? PM is unsuitable for analog radio or TV broadcasts because it's digital. When we use AM, FM or PM modes to transmit * and - (or 0s and 1s), we have digital transmission. When we use AM or FM to propagate composite waves, it's analog transmission. Analog signals are continuous while digital signals are discrete. In one critical respect, water waves and electromagnetic waves -- such as radio signals -- differ. Water waves travel on a medium. Electromagnetic waves consist of electrical and magnetic fields oscillating in the three spatial dimensions. This said, an electromagnetic wave's phase, frequency, and amplitude can communicate messages the same way waves on the surface of an ideal lake can. How is signal modulation used? An important advantage of modulation is that multiple signals modulated differently can travel in the same channel -- like the airwaves in a city or a fibre-optic cable -- without interrupting each other. In the same vein, lightning produces radio waves that interfere with signals, resulting in static and noise. They have little influence on digital transmission thanks to modulation. This is why we have advanced communications technologies like the internet. Operators prefer television and signals to be analog instead because analog receivers are cheaper. This is why TV and radio broadcast signals are AM or FM. The International Telecommunication Union allocates frequency bands to different services to minimise interference and increase transmission efficiency. AM's frequency range, from 535 to 1,705 kHz, makes room for high wavelength signals that can pass over mountains and buildings, providing more coverage. FM provides superior quality since it is unaffected by static. However, because its frequency range is 88-108 MHz, the waves have lower wavelengths and the transmission distance is limited to line of sight. The receiver is also more expensive. Nonetheless, as the prices of electronic components continue to decline, the world at large is moving from analog to digital broadcasting. T.V.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/report-highlights-poor-state-of-sewage-treatment-plants-installed-near-bengaluru-lakes/article68638697.ece,"A report by Action Aid has highlighted the poor state of sewage treatment plants (STPs) associated with lakes in Bengaluru. The report, which analysed 15 STPs run by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), highlighted several shortcomings such as fish kill in lakes despite the presence of STPs; the STP water not being tested for several parameters given by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), and identical values recorded during consecutive months suggesting potential irregularities. Poor quality According to the study, in spite of the STPs, water quality at 12 of 15 analysed lakes was categorised as Class E by KSPCB multiple times. Higher levels of biological content in the water have also been observed. This suggests serious pollution in the lakes, a lack of use of the STPs, inadequacies in STP maintenance, and ineffective monitoring of pollution in the lakes which needs urgent attention and action at the BBMP, noted the report. ""The reported instances of fish kill in lakes with STPs attached to them during 2023 underscore potential shortcomings in pollution control and water quality management efforts. Despite the implementation of STPs, intended to mitigate pollution and safeguard aquatic ecosystems, the fish kill indicates a possible failure in addressing water quality issues adequately,"" said the report, which used RTI responses, KSPCB water quality reports, and field visits to analyse 15 lakes in the city where STPs have been installed. Recommendations The study, which suggested further investigation to pinpoint factors contributing to such incidents, made several recommendations. They include a comprehensive evaluation of the functioning and effectiveness of all the STPs; conforming water quality analysis tests to KSPCB standards; investigation into questionable water quality reports of STPs installed at Challakere and Kalena Agrahara lakes, and handing over STPs run by BBMP to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB). ""The primary role of the BWSSB is to supply water, collect sewage, treat it, and let it into the environment. They have the proficiency and have been doing it for the last 60-plus years. Alternatively, the BBMP has to set up an effective monitoring of STPs and lake water quality,"" it says. Earlier this week, Environment Minister Eshwar Khandre wrote to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to propose water purification plants near lakes in Bengaluru, and supply the treated water for building construction and industrial activities."

This is in addition to forming a security audit committee with monthly meetings to review safety protocols, establishing a central control room monitored by ex-Army personnel, and constituting a committee at the State Secretariat to oversee implementation of al the security measures that have been planned. This decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Minister for Medical Education and Skill Development Sharan Prakash Patil in Bengaluru on Friday. The meeting was held to discuss measures for tightening security at medical colleges, hospitals, and hostels in the wake of the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata that has raised concerns about the safety of women in the health sector. At the meeting, which is second in the series, Dr. Patil emphasised the importance of integrating feedback from women healthcare professionals and other stakeholders. ""Directors of medical institutions must gather feedback in writing and take concrete steps to implement necessary measures,"" he said. He also instructed that thorough background checks should be conducted for all security personnel. Similarly, 24/7 canteen facilities should be available so that women healthcare staff do not need to leave the premises, he said. The Minister stressed the need for following guidelines prescribed by the Union government and the Supreme Court on safety measures. According to an official release, the proposed personal safety measures include color-coded ID badges, personal security alarms, SOS remotes, and hooters. Other initiatives include safe transportation options, counselling services, and training in self-defense and crisis response. At the meeting, officials presented plans to establish a central control room monitored by ex-Army personnel, where CCTV camera surveillance and personal security alarm systems will be monitored around the clock. The control room will also operate a 24/7 helpline, they said. The security system will be further strengthened through the integration of AI technology to ensure comprehensive protection across medical campuses, they explained. Efforts were also being made to install more CCTV cameras, improve street lighting, and provide separate duty rooms and restrooms for male and female staff, they said. Dr. Patil announced that a panel will be formed at the State Secretariat to oversee the implementation of these measures. The Minister warned that medical institutions' directors would be held accountable for any security lapses. He also directed the Medical Education Department to initiate new tenders for the procurement of drugs."

""Delay in such cases, where the offences are heinous based on facts that are horrendous, is a sad reflection of the legal and judicial system,"" the High Court observed. Specific time frame The High Court also pointed out that though Section 35(2) of the POCSO Act mandates completion within one year, there are many cases pending before the trial courts concerned. Justice M. Nagaprasanna made these observation while noticing that though cognisance in the criminal was taken against the two accused persons in 2017 itself, the offenders are yet to be brought to justice. One of the accused, Chandana, had moved the High Court for recalling nine witnesses for cross-examination on the ground that the trial court rejected the application even though the accused's advocate could not cross examine the witnesses owing to ill health. Repeated applications However, the High Court noticed from the records that one of the reasons for the delay was due to repeated filling of application on behalf of the petitioner for recalling of witnesses for further cross examination. Based on this finding, the court permitted recalling of nine witnesses, as the right of their cross examination was not availed of by the accused, with a condition that cross examination should be completed within nine days, and the entire trial should be completed within three months from the date of completion of cross examination."

Over 23,000 eligible candidates from different parts of Karnataka registered online. The fair received a good response and nearly 15,000 candidates came for it, he said. Many unemployed candidates have been facing financial difficulties as they took out educational loans and completed graduation and postgraduation studies, Mr. Muniyappa said. Financial aid The government has implemented the Yuva Nidhi scheme for providing monthly financial aid of Rs3,000 for unemployed graduates and Rs1,500 for diploma candidates. But permanent employment would empower the youth and make them financially independent, he said. National and global companies took part in the job fair and promised to provide jobs to suitable candidates in their firms. ""This is the right platform for unemployed graduates and skilled persons to find jobs as per their qualification,"" Mr. Muniyappa said. Bengaluru Rural Deputy Commissioner N.

Four people have been arrested in this connection, they said. ""These four are suspected to have provided logistical support to the shooters. They are being further interrogated by a Special Cell team,"" a senior officer said. The arrested accused have been identified as Nitalesh Tiwari, Vishal Verma and Akash Yadav of Uttar Pradesh's Azamgarh, and Naveen Baliyan of Haryana's Sonipat. Two country-made pistols and eight live rounds were seized from them. The officer said two more people were detained and questioned in connection with the case but the main shooter remained on the run. The police also suspect the involvement of associates of jailed gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi and Hashim Baba in the murder. Nadir Shah -- who previously had criminal cases, including extortion, robbery and attempted murder, against him -- co-owned a gym in Greater Kailash 1. He would also lend money on very high interest rates, police sources said. Shah owned a business in Dubai and was stated to be known to some Delhi police officials. He is survived by his mother and two brothers. Shah's father hailed from Afghanistan and moved to Delhi several years ago. At the time of the incident, some officials of the Delhi Police's Special Cell were present at the gym, where they had gone to meet an informer, a source said. Shah was talking to a friend outside the gym when he was shot at around 10.44 pm, the police said. CCTV camera footage purporting to show Shah talking to a person as an attacker walks towards him and fires a volley of bullets from close range later surfaced on social media. The police suspect the attacker fled on a motorcycle with an associate, who was waiting for him. Another police source said the background of the man Shah was talking to when he was attacked had been verified. He told the police that he had come with a woman friend, who was sitting in his car at that time, the second source said. Minutes after, a post was shared on a social media account claiming to be that of gangster Rohit Godara, taking responsibility for the shooting. The post said the shooting was ordered by Sameer Baba, a jailed criminal, as Shah was causing troubling in his business. ""Whoever will support our rival and trouble us will be shot like this,"" it added. The post also mentioned the names of Lawrence Bishnoi's associates Godara, Goldy Brar, Gogi gang and Kala Rana gang. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Ankit Chauhan said they received information about the shooting at Greater Kailash 1 and one person being taken to Max Hospital. Personnel rushed to the spot and found bullet projectiles and empty cartridges. Upon inquiry, it was found that Shah, a resident of CR Park, had suffered five bullet injuries, the police said. ""The attackers came on a two wheeler, fired at him and fled. He was immediately rushed to the hospital by his friends but was declared dead,"" Chauhan said. The investigators are looking at all possible angles, he added. The police suspect a case of rivalry but did not rule out the possibility of a gang war."

This will be the first visit by a Prime Minister to Doda in the last 42 years. Multi-tier security has been deployed across the twin districts of Doda and Kishtwar, particularly around the venue, to ensure a peaceful and smooth conduct of the election rally, which will be held at the stadium in Doda town. ""Prime Minister Modi will hold his first election meeting in Doda tomorrow. This will be a significant event as it marks the first visit of any Prime Minister to Doda in 42 years. The last prime ministerial visit to Doda was in 1982,"" said Union Coal and Mines Minister and BJP election in-charge for Jammu & Kashmir, G Kishan Reddy, on Friday in Samba. Mr. Modi's rally is all set to give boost to his cadres and candidates in the region where voting for eight Assembly seats in the three districts of the Chenab Valley -- Doda, Kishtwar, and Ramban -- is scheduled for September 18. During the 2014 Assembly elections, PM Modi addressed a BJP poll rally in Kishtwar district. Since then, the people of Doda have been eagerly waiting to see and hear the Prime Minister, a leader said. BJP leaders believe that the Prime Minister's visit will significantly boost the electoral prospects of party candidates in the union territory. The party is contesting all 43 Assembly seats in the Jammu division. In the last J&K Assembly, BJP had 25 MLAs. Voting in the J&K Assembly elections will be held in three phases on September 18, September 25, and October 1. The counting of votes will take place on October 8. This is the first Assembly election in J&K in 10 years, and the first since the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A. The Jammu region has long been a BJP stronghold, with the party winning all 25 of its seats from this region in the 2014 Assembly polls in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/present-statute-details-backing-hydraa-hc-to-government/article68639591.ece,"Justice K. Lakshman of Telangana High Court on Friday directed the State government to present before the court all details connected to constitution of HYDRAA (Hyderabad Disaster Response and Assets Monitoring and Protection) along with the statute behind it. The Judge directed nine officials, including the Chief Secretary, to file their responses by September 19 in a writ petition filed by a septuagenarian woman D. Lakshmi from Nanakramguda of Hyderabad. The petitioner challenged the legal sanctity of HYDRAA, seeking a direction to quash GO Ms. no. 99 of July 19 through which the agency was constituted. The petitioner contended that teams of HYDRAA razed some rooms constructed in her patta land at Ailapur village of Ameenpur mandal on city outskirts coming under Sangareeddy district. Describing the demolition as illegal, the petitioner said no notice was issued by the authorities or any order for demolition by any court was not shown to her. The GO was issued through the Executive powers conferred on the government through Article 162 of the Constitution, the petitioner's counsel said. However, it was mandatory that such order should have been backed by a specific statute since it was applied to the specific field of illegal encroachments of water bodies, the counsel said. According to the petitioner, the GHMC Act did not allow the government to delegate the statutory power of the civic body to another authority like HYDRAA. Thus the statutory functions assigned to GHMC cannot be delegated to any agency like HYDRAA without bringing in specific Act to that extent. The counsel contended that the GO 99 was vague and granted unfettered discretion to HYDRAA to derive its power from any law to justify its actions. Such delegation of power without any limitations was not permitted under the law, the lawyer said."
