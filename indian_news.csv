https://zeenews.india.com/world/right-now-im-leading-donald-trump-on-another-debate-with-kamala-harris-2793105.html,"Former US President Donald Trump suggested on Friday that he would reconsider holding a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris if he got in the right mood, CNN reported.  He further added that his mind might change regarding the presidential debate with Harris, however, nothing can be said now.  ""I did great with the debates, and I think they've answered everything. But maybe if I got in the right mood, I don't know,"" Trump said.  ""Right now, I'm leading,"" he affirmed.  On being asked
by the media what exactly he would need or want in order to participate in another debate with Harris, Trump responded by saying, ""I wouldn't need anything. I could do it tomorrow, but I've done two debates,"" as he referred to his previous debate with US President Joe Biden.  The possibility of a second meeting between the two US Presidential candidates before election day was dashed on Thursday when former President Donald Trump announced he would not take part in another debate with Vice
President Kamala Harris.  He asserted that he won Tuesday's debate with Harris despite some polls showing otherwise.  ""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, 'I WANT A REMATCH'. Polls clearly show that I won the debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats' Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.  The former president claimed that subjects like immigration and inflation were
covered ""in great detail"" both in Tuesday night's discussion with Harris and in his June debate with President Biden.  Trump, in a strong attack on the Biden-Harris administration, said that they have 'destroyed' the country.  ""She and Crooked Joe have destroyed our country, with millions of criminals and mentally deranged people pouring into the USA, totally unchecked and unvetted, and with inflation bankrupting our middle class.  Everyone knows this and all of the other problems caused by
Kamala and Joe. It was discussed in great detail during the first debate with Joe, and the second debate with Comrade Harris,"" the former US President said.  ""She was a no-show at the Fox debate and refused to do NBC & CBS,"" Trump said in his post, adding ""KAMALA SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!""  Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are the official presidential candidates of their respective parties, after they
accepted the nomination at the conventions earlier this year.  The US presidential elections are scheduled to be held on November 5 this year.  Notably, the first presidential debate was held in June between President Biden and Trump, where the former's performance expressed concerns over his age. Following this, Biden made an exit from the race and endorsed Harris.  It is pertinent to note that Trump and Harris debated on Tuesday this week. It was their first meeting since Harris became the
Democratic presidential nominee in late July, The Hill reported.  The ultimate face off between Trump and Harris took place during the presidential debate conducted by ABC News."

The release came on the heels of the pop icon's high-profile endorsement of Kamala Harris on social media. The T-shirts follow a similar pattern and design concept but replace the singer's face with that of Trump's. The tees also feature ""Donald J Trump"" and ""Make America Great Again"" in a font,
echoing the Eras Tour design.  As soon as the merchandise came out, the striking resemblance created a major stir online, with many Swift fans calling out the former president. While some suggested that the TTPD singer sue Trump for copyright infringement, others criticised him for what they see as an unnecessary attack on Swift.

September 12, 2024  ""This is literally copyrighted so have fun being sued,"" another comment read.  Prior to this, Taylor Swift publicly expressed her support for Kamala Harris, praising her leadership qualities and values on social media. Swift also went on to criticise Trump for using AI-generated images of her. In a long post with a picture of herself with her cat Benjamin, the singer noted that she would vote for Harris, who she believes ""fights for the rights and causes I believe need a
warrior to champion them."" She added, ""I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader, and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.""  Hitting out at Trump, she called out the use of AI for falsely endorsing the former president in her name. ""It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.
The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,"" she wrote.  This came years after the singer had shown her support for Democrat Joe Biden back in 2020. At that time as well, she remained openly critical of Trump."
https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-paints-kamala-harris-red-in-quest-for-votes-in-the-last-lap-of-presidential-race/article68641310.ece,"""Everyone knows she's a Marxist,"" Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has repeated loudly and often, referring to his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, who he is hoping to tar with one of the oldest brushes in the U.S. political playbook.  The aim? To portray Harris as a dangerous left-wing extremist, and to invoke the infamous Cold War-era ""red scare"" in the United States.  In recent weeks, the former president has stepped up his rhetoric against the Vice President, describing her as
both a ""Marxist"" and a ""communist"" at almost every opportunity.  Ms. Harris has not directly addressed the taunts, but her policies over decades of holding public office do not appear to conform to either the 19th-century German theorist's views or the various left-wing schools of thought that followed him.  ""She's not a Marxist, she's not a communist,"" said Thomas Zeitzoff, a professor at American University and a specialist on political violence.  For the Republican camp, using such terms is
""a way of trying to say that she's extreme,"" he told AFP.  Mr. Trump, experts say, is using an age-old US political tactic called ""red-baiting,"" which aims to discredit an opponent by accusing them of not being a capitalist.  Paranoia  The strategy involves labelling an opponent as a ""communist,"" ""socialist,"" ""Marxist,"" or a ""red,"" said Barbara Perry, a Presidential studies professor at the University of Virginia.  It is ""an attempt not only to denigrate them, but also to get them to fight back
and maybe present themselves in a not very nice way,"" she added.  Ms. Perry said the terms were ""very weighted"" in the United States, and invoke the repeated ""red scares"" of the era following the two world wars, when Washington was competing with the Soviet Union for dominance.  ""The country tends to turn inward at those times"" of competition with a rival ideology, she said.  The most well-known example of the ""red scare"" phenomenon was practiced by U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, the chief ""red
baiter and the witch hunter in the Senate,"" Perry said.  A fervent anti-communist, McCarthy warned of the supposed infiltration of communists into every stratum of American society, creating a widespread climate of paranoia across the country.  ""Red baiting also has this... long history in the US, and it's kind of interesting to see it sort of come back,"" said Zeitzoff.  He also identified a common thread running between McCarthy and Trump: a lawyer named Roy Cohn.  Mr. Cohn was an advisor to
McCarthy, and in the 1970s became a mentor to the real estate magnate and future president of the United States, Mr. Trump.  Narrow margins  Ms. Harris only became the Democratic Party's Presidential candidate in July, after President Joe Biden dramatically dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate performance against Trump.  With voters having a limited time to get to know the vice president, Trump has attempted to influence their image by repeatedly characterizing her as a
communist.  To explain why Mr. Trump has done this, both Zeitzoff and Perry use the same metaphor: of throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks.  Mr. Trump appears to be trying to attract a certain type of voters by calling Ms. Harris a ""Marxist,"" said Zeitzoff, particularly Hispanic and Latino Americans.  Many voters from that background may have come from families that fled communist countries and therefore have unfavorable views of them.  Mr. Trump is also targeting another
demographic with this rhetoric: older voters.  ""There will be some people in the electorate who are remembering, as I can... the height of the Cold War,"" Perry said.  ""So there will be, certainly, people who know that communism is bad and think communism is bad to this day.""  In his book ""Nasty Politics,"" Zeitzoff argued that the use of insults, conspiracy theories and aggressive rhetoric was not particularly effective in influencing voters to change camps.  Nevertheless, with the current
election on a knife edge -- the candidates are neck-and-neck in most polls, including in battleground states -- Mr. Trump's red baiting could make a difference.  ""The margins are really narrow. So maybe this, you know, is persuadable to some people at the edge,"" Zeitzoff said."
https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-election-2024/story/us-elections-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-on-legalising-marijuana-2599894-2024-09-14,"The US Presidential elections are only weeks away with candidates and voters both gearing up for the final phase. Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump put on a good show during the recent presidential debate in Philadelphia. But many issues remain undiscussed. Interestingly, one such issue is that of federal marijuana legalisation, something both candidates might have more to agree on rather than disagree with.  advertisement  It is a valid prospect to think that this
election might finally result in some federal changes to the ban on recreational marijuana usage which has been in place for over 100 years.  Interestingly, in the US, 24 states and the District of Columbia -- representing 53 per cent of the nation's population -- have legalised marijuana and now tax and regulate marijuana sales similar to alcohol, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports legalising cannabis.  An additional seven states have removed jail sentences for possessing
small amounts of marijuana. A total of 38 states and the District of Columbia have laws that allow the medical use of marijuana.  About 70 per cent of American adults said marijuana should be legal in a Gallup poll taken last year, the highest level recorded by the polling firm since it first asked about marijuana policy in 1969.  Times are changing, and it is, therefore, going to be an interesting election on November 5, with both candidates leaning in similar directions, despite numerous other
disagreements.  KAMALA HARRIS' STANCE  The Vice-President has had an interesting journey when it comes to legalising marijuana. Although she introduced a Senate bill in 2019 to federally decriminalise marijuana, and noted incarceration for marijuana possession shouldn't happen, Harris was not always this easy-going.  Harris's reign as the San Francisco District Attorney saw her office convict almost 2,000 people for marijuana-related crimes, according to the Washington Post. During her 2010 run
to be California's attorney general, she vehemently opposed legalising marijuana for recreational use.  And then, by 2019, she was suddenly advocating for legalisation and admitted, as a presidential candidate, to indulging in some grass herself. She has since advocated for numerous policies and pardons for those convicted of marijuana use.  ""Nobody should have to go to jail for smoking weed,"" Harris said. ""And what we need to do is recognise that far too many people have been sent to jail for
simple marijuana possession.""  With Harris in office, it would be safe to assume that marijuana might soon have its day in the sun.  DONALD TRUMP's STANCE  Then comes former President Donald Trump. He has toed a line when it comes to legalising marijuana. He seldom speaks against it or for it. When he does, it's more ambiguous than clear. As President, he pardoned a drug dealer serving a life sentence, but then spoke of his intention in 2023 to give the death penalty to all drug dealers.  Then,
only days ago, he voiced his support the most clearly as he ever has, on Truth Social, saying that he would be voting in favour of the Florida Ballot initiative to legalise marijuana.  ""I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults to safe, tested, products,"" he wrote on Truth Social on September 9.  He added: ""As President, we will continue to
focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking for state authorised companies, and supporting states' rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.""  Whether this transpires is yet to be seen, but the signs are encouraging that marijuana may finally see federal legislation within the next decade. But the thing which is sure is, the elections on
November 5 will have a say in it.  Published By: Aryan Published On: Sep 14, 2024"

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-age-family-net-worth-political-career-and-more-6558144,"Donald Trump is contesting for second term as US President.  Donald John Trump has had a profound impact on US politics. His presidency is still, and perhaps forever, be remembered for bold statements and decisions he took. To explain who Donald Trump is and what makes him tick involves lots of metaphors. From ""insomniac"", to ""Godzilla"" and a ""Navy SEAL"", the 45th President of the United States has earned praises and brickbats from his countrymen.  Mr Trump, born into wealth and growing up in
the heart of New York's business world, rose to global prominence as POTUS. From real estate mogul to reality TV star to the most powerful political figure in America, his life has been anything but conventional. His presidency (2017-2021) saw major political upheaval, deeply polarising the nation. Even after his term ended, Trump continues to dominate the political conversation, and in a debate with Vice President and Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, he made a strong pitch why the US needs him
in power.  Donald Trump Birth And Early Life  Photo Credit: Getty  He was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York City, to Frederick Christ Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, and Mary Anne MacLeod, a Scottish immigrant. He was the fourth of five children in a well-off family that built its fortune in the post-World War II construction boom.  Fred Trump was a powerful figure in real estate, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, which profoundly influenced Donald's ambitions. Raised with a
competitive spirit and taught the value of success from a young age, Donald followed closely in his father's footsteps. His early years were marked by privilege but also discipline. Trump's parents sent him to the New York Military Academy at age 13 to channel his energy and focus on his studies.  Donald Trump Education  Trump attended the New York Military Academy before moving on to Fordham University for two years. He then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,
where he earned a degree in economics in 1968.  Armed with a business education and the family fortune, Trump joined his father's real estate business, eventually taking control in 1971 and renaming it The Trump Organisation. His early projects included transforming rundown buildings in Manhattan into luxury high-rises. Trump's career was characterised by a knack for branding and a relentless pursuit of high-profile deals. Notably, he developed the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York and Trump Tower
on Fifth Avenue, both of which bolstered his reputation as a high-stakes real estate mogul.  In the 1980s, Trump expanded into the casino business with mixed success. His ventures, such as Trump Plaza and Trump Castle helped cement his image as a larger-than-life businessman, though financial trouble followed. Trump's companies declared bankruptcy several times, but he consistently rebounded, largely due to his mastery of public relations and branding.  Donald Trump Marriages  Photo Credit:
Getty  Trump's personal life, including his three marriages, has been as highly publicised as his professional one. His first marriage, to Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech model and businesswoman, lasted from 1977 to 1992, according to the BBC. Together, they had three children: Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump. The couple was a fixture in the New York social scene throughout the 1980s, though their relationship ended in a widely publicised divorce amid rumours of Trump's infidelity.  In 1993, Trump
married actress Marla Maples, with whom he had one daughter, Tiffany Trump. This marriage, too, ended in divorce, in 1999.  In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss, with whom he has a son, Barron Trump. Melania would go on to become the First Lady during Trump's presidency. Throughout his personal and professional life, Trump has kept his family close, with his children playing prominent roles in both his business empire and his political campaigns.  Donald Trump Net Worth  In May
this year, Forbes released the answer to the question people were asking for decades - what's Donald Trump really worth? As per the magazine, $7.5 billion. The figure includes the assets and businesses the former US President owns. Truth Social, the platform Trump owns, is alone worth $5.6 billion. His real estate business is worth $1.1 billion, while the clubs and resorts $0.81 billion. Mr Trump has $0.41 billion as cash and $0.1 billion in other assets, as per Forbes.  The outlet further said
that he reached the $1 billion mark in 1988, but was out of Forbes' 400 list from 1990 to 1995.  Donald Trump Age  At 78, Trump is still actively involved in politics and business. He maintains a high-profile presence, particularly through his social media platform, Truth Social.  Donald Trump Presidency  Though Trump flirted with politics for years, his serious plunge into the political arena came in 2015 when he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President. Few in the
Republican Party believed when Trump launched his improbable White House bid that he'd still be a factor at the end of that year. But the billionaire topped national polls after entering the race, as per CNN.  Donald Trump quickly emerged as the frontrunner, gaining notoriety for his unfiltered rhetoric, often attacking rivals and the media. His promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and his tough stance on immigration became central themes of his campaign.  In November 2016, Trump
defied pollsters and political analysts by defeating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in one of the most shocking political upsets in US history. His electoral victory, largely fuelled by wins in key swing states, underscored the deep divides in American society.  Trump's presidency was marked by a series of unconventional and controversial actions, from his combative relationship with the press to his unpredictable foreign policy moves. Domestically, Trump implemented tax cuts, rolled back
regulations, and installed conservative judges at a record pace, including three Supreme Court Justices, reshaping the judiciary for decades.  Donald Trump political career  One of the Trump administration's defining moments came in 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump's handling of the crisis received heavy criticism, with detractors accusing him of downplaying the severity of the virus and mishandling the federal response. His administration's policies on immigration, trade and
race relations also ignited fierce debates and further polarised the country.  Trump's foreign policy approach was similarly contentious. He withdrew the US from several international agreements, including the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal, while also seeking a more assertive stance against China. Trump's ""America First"" policy, which often alienated traditional US allies, further underscored his unorthodox approach to global affairs.  In December 2019, Trump became the third US
president to be impeached by the House of Representatives, accused of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. The Senate ultimately acquitted him in February 2020. He was impeached for the second time by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2021, one week before his term expired for incitement of insurrection. He is the only US President to be impeached twice."

Melania has only been seen with her husband a few times this year, other than
the RNC. In April, they attended a campaign fundraiser in Florida, and in May, they attended Barron's high school graduation. Trump was permitted to attend the event one day after his hush money criminal trial in New York.She did not attend Trump's first debate of his campaign against President Joe Biden in July, which ultimately led to the president dropping out of the race and Harris stepping up to lead the Democratic ticket. Melania did, however, attend Trump's debate against Biden back in
2020, where the candidates greeted their spouses post-event, which saw the frosty ex-model sharply pull her hand away as the Trumps exited the stage.Former First Lady Melania posted a cryptic video urging the truth about her husband's assassination attempt, despite being absent from the debate. She has also promoted her upcoming memoir, Melania, and commented on the US's divided state since her husband's 2020 election loss.Melania Trump has largely avoided her husband's political appearances,
such as the most recent debate in Philadelphia. Since the re-election campaign began, she has not made many public appearances, preferring to work on personal endeavours like her impending memoir.Melania released a mysterious video hours before the debate, in which she demanded to know the truth about an alleged attempt on her husband's life. Her family was completely unaware of her decision to share the video, so it was unexpected."
