The film also stars other favourite actors of
the filmmaker, like Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav and Asrani. Priyadarshan got talking to us about his new film and his partnership with Akshay Kumar.  Priyadarshan on the subject of his Akshay Kumar starrer Bhooth Bangla, ""It is based on mythology and black magic, it is inspired by Vedas and Mahabharat""  You are back with Bhooth Bangla with Akshay and all your favourite actors  Yes, Akshay and I are getting together after fourteen years. And all my other favourite actors, Asrani, Rajpal Yadav and
others, are in it too. At this stage of the project, I can only guarantee the audience a laugh riot.  That's what you are known for  Yes, in the Hindi belt. In the South I've done the other kind of cinema, which you like. The serious kind.  Priyan, everyone is talking about Bhooth Bangla  Are they? You tell me? You are the one who keeps track of all the happenings in the film industry. I don't know how you do it from Patna. For me, every film I make is a new beginning. After almost a hundred
films, I still feel the same excitement and nervousness I felt when I made my first film.  Have you seen the old Bhoot Bangla with Mehmood?  No, I haven't. Why should I? My film has nothing to do with that old Bhoot Bangla. I don't know what that is about.  What is your film about?  Ah, it's a new experiment in the comedy-horror genre. If you remember I had introduced the horror-comedy genre in Bhool Bhulaiya seventeen years ago.  Yes, and everyone including the makers of Stree is inspired by it
Ha ha, I am not saying anything. You are. I don't look over my shoulders at what others are doing. In fact, I don't even look at my own films. Once I finish making it, I move on. This is why I never did a sequel to Hera Pheri. Why should I do the same thing when there are so many stories to tell?  Akshay and you had last collaborated on Khatta Meetha fourteen years ago. He is currently going through a lean phase. Does that bother you?  Who hasn't gone through a lean phase in his career? I have.
Haven't you? I have seen so many ups and downs, I am still here. I know there are people who want me to retire. I am sure many people would love to see you retire. But why should we? As long as I've the fire in my belly to make films, I will continue to do. Of course I've made bad films. And they've failed. But I've also made superhit films, in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi. People watch my old comedies when they want to cheer up.  Have you noticed any changes in Akshay Kumar since you last
worked with him?  He is still the same. We are like two children with a new toy. Akshay has the indomitable spirit of a true hero. Nothing can keep him down. Both of us are very excited about getting together again. It is like old times again. Mohanlal and Akshay are two actors who trust me implicitly. Would you believe, Mohanlal doesn't even ask for a script; he just says yes when I offer him a film. When it comes to Mohanlal and Akshay, my responsibility multiplies because of their trust in
me.  What is Bhooth Bangla about?  You want me to tell you the whole story? I can't do that. But yes, I will tell you this. It will be a new phase in the horror-comedy space. Bhooth Bangla is based on mythology and black magic. It is inspired by our Vedas and even the Mahabharat. But black magic is the dominant theme. It is a fun film. My audience which has leaned on me for entertainment for 42 years won't be disappointed. This is the kind of cinema audiences want me to make.  What about the
cinema that you want to make, like Kanchivaram?  There are two Priyadarshans: the one who makes the cinema he believes in, like the recent anthology of Vasudev Nair's stories Manorathangal. Then there is the other Priyadarshan, who makes the films audiences want. I am equally proud of both. Bhooth Bangla gives me the leverage and courage to make the other kind of films. But Subhash, do you know what makes me happy?  Tell me  To stay relevant as an artiste, that's the main thing. When Ektaa R
Kapoor came forward to produce Bhooth Bangla, she offered me a huge amount of remuneration saying I deserved no less. It's not the money that made me happy. It was the thought behind it.  How is your rapport with Ektaa R Kapoor?  Wonderful. She is a fighter, like you and me.

Explaining why he doesn't see it that way, the Stree 2 actor said, ""I have learned a lot from Akshay sir. I grew up watching stars like him. He is our superstar, and you don't compete with your superstar, you love them. I am his fan.""  The actor continued, ""I've learned so much by watching people like
Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Hrithik Roshan, and Akshay sir. They'll always be my superstars, and I'll always look up to them.""  He further said, ""I'm so middle-class that even today, if I get a call from Akshay Kumar, I stand up in excitement and tell everyone, 'Look, Akshay sir is calling!' I can't believe I'm working in the same industry as the people I've admired all my life. Competing with them is unimaginable.""  Rajkummar Rao's upcoming film Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video has
